    "transcript": "1 2 3 hi everyone brat theny green Tano here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new record brat from Charlie XCX here we have the sixth official fulllength studio album from pop singer and songwriter Miss Charlie XX one of my most anticipated albums of the Year why well over the past decade in my eyes Charlie has grown into one of the most creative unique and pioneering forces in current day pop music and her Evolution has been interesting to watch to say the least I&amp;#39;m not a fan of her early work truth be told but today it serves as an interesting reference point uh for what she&amp;#39;s doing on this record the True Romance and sucker eras of her career uh did bring some of her biggest hits and features to date that is true but sonically much of the music she was dropping around this time wasn&amp;#39;t very daring or even deep at best you could say it was catchy and of the time around the mid-2010s though is when Charlie&amp;#39;s music really began to push boundaries crossing over creatively with writers and producers from the upand cominging PC music label I&amp;#39;m talking people like Danielle harl and easy fun AG cook and the late Sophie who at the time were gaining quite the reputation for revitalizing a lot of Y2K era pop Aesthetics but with a hyper futuristic jittery sound and our first taste of this new Direction came in the form of Charlie X X X&amp;#39;s vom vroom EP in 2016 which some critics just did not know what to make of at the time and while it was my EP of the year that year I could still see how this would have turned a lot of people off if they came into Charlie&amp;#39;s music having certain expectations given that she was a pop artist because vroom vroom in tone is at points kind of dark and visceral and groovy in a weird way campy too with some tracks varying so wildly from part to part that uh you could almost take what she was doing here as like a joke or a novelty however the tracks on this EP are deadly serious and were also a new bold step for pop music as well as an aha moment for both Charlie and PC music creatively because at this point I think Charlie became the perfect conduit for what they were trying to channel this detailed and retrofuturistic reconstruction of 2000&amp;#39;s pop music that lur the lines between satirical but also reverent meanwhile Charlie&amp;#39;s creative chemistry with ag and Sophie allowed her I think to experiment more and mature as a songwriter allowing her the freedom to drop zany bangers as well as Sleek powerful anthems songs with strange structures or very unlikely features a lot of these ideas and Concepts were more or less Road tested on the mixtape she dropped back in 2017 and then in my eyes it was all fully realized on her excellent 2019 Charlie record now over the years as Charlie has developed this new sound her writing has offered more depth has become more personal and intimate especially on her pandemic album how I&amp;#39;m feeling now but I think Charlie&amp;#39;s writing has grown more conceptual too with her presentation as this Posh English party girl on many of her songs has more or less become like this exaggerated character she plays into however in a way Charlie&amp;#39;s instantly recognizable sound and unique place in the pop landscape uh became both a blessing and a curse at the dawn of the 2020s because her style had gone from challenging to uh kind of definable with this newly minted hyperpop term that was uh being thrown onto everybody who sounded even vaguely like her or 100 gex and she quickly went on to strip away many of the hyper characteristics of her music on her next album crack working with a totally new team of producers and while I can&amp;#39;t deny the record does feature some respectable hits I have to ask at what cost because crash did very measurably have quite a bit less character than anything Charlie had dropped in recent years at the time which brings us to today Charlie&amp;#39;s latest album cycle here brat where I think she&amp;#39;s genuinely reconnecting with the trajectory that has brought her to this point and made her a special artist to begin with even easy fun and AG cook are back in the mix on the production side on a whole lot of tracks uh numerous others too there are even references to AG cook uh on some of the lyrics to This Record as quite a bit of meta commentary is going on as well you can really tell that Charlie is fully embracing the impact she&amp;#39;s had on pop music in recent years and uh really using it as uh more of a strength than uh weakness that she can be sort of pigeonholed into and I think that&amp;#39;s something she can do confidently because uh her and AG cook aren&amp;#39;t just merely trying to you know revive uh some kind of hyperpop trend on this LP I mean for sure Charlie&amp;#39;s goal and focus is to give us this autotuned bold and hard hitting homage to 2000&amp;#39;s era pop music but this time around we have a refreshing focus on dance pop on EDM from that era on electropop from that era Club bangers generally with a pretty aggressive Edge making this LP very worthy of the title brat because this record is meant to be danced to and at points cried to as I think Charlie&amp;#39;s writing is more mature and thoughtful than it&amp;#39;s ever been for one her party girl Persona takes a bit of a dark turn or at least gets deflated a bit as she reveals that it&amp;#39;s kind of a mask and uh that she doesn&amp;#39;t always feel uh like she&amp;#39;s a worthy of being there at the party or you know that her and the party are a bit at odds meanwhile I think about it all all the time sees Charlie uh musing about whether or not she can continue her career in the way she currently is while also becoming a mother which he very clearly has interest in at some point skipping ahead here it&amp;#39;s also kind of crazy how narratively this contrasts so hard with her going back full into party mode on the closing track 365 of course there are notes of nostalgia on this album too that uh is very much in line with tracks like 1999 most notably on rewind but this song specifically is more about Charlie missing older aspects of her life before the fame between sticky choruses on this track she delivers her verses in this way that kind of comes off like a conflicted internal monologue or like she&amp;#39;s musically journaling there are lots of tracks on this thing too that deal in love but these songs narratively feel vastly different from previous singles like good ones for example tracks where historically Charlie can be seen running away from love or being a bit self-effacing and talking about how she&amp;#39;s [ __ ] it all up instead on songs such as the really infectious talk talk to me as as well as the very cinematic everything is romantic yeah Charlie can be seen accepting love and uh doing quite a few shout outs to her fiance George but yes between this and numerous nods to wanting to have maybe a more normal life at some point Charlie really presents some interesting internal conflicts throughout this album which we also hear as well on tracks where she is singing about things like friendship and sharing the Limelight with other women I mean historically Charlie is a very proom especially when it comes to uh supporting other artists with her music through features through attention she can throw their way with her creativity I mean even look at the lyrics in the music video to one of the big singles from this record 360 that is the Charlie that most fans know and love by that same token there are numerous songs on this record where uh she is being very unfiltered in just admitting how just insecure and plagued with fear she is sometimes their sympathy is a knife where uh she talks about just being so self-conscious around this other woman that she wishes for a gun to shoot herself with which is context that some fans might even miss if they&amp;#39;re mostly wrapped up in the Roaring bass and uh fantastic string hits going on on the dance beat there&amp;#39;s also girl so confusing where Charlie things about the difficulties of letting people in and navigating the music industry among other people who uh she may have a difficult time connecting with knowing how to trust the song seems to be very specifically about a single person who uh maybe she&amp;#39;s been likened to by fans but she doesn&amp;#39;t fully see it however there&amp;#39;s still a desire there on some level to make the friendship or the connection work then the song Von Dutch sees Charlie getting pretty aggressive and combative lyrically specifically in regards to someone who doesn&amp;#39;t seem to like her maybe even is talking behind her back and her response to that is essentially this big anthemic [ __ ] you here where she&amp;#39;s delivering some biting lyrics about how this person may actually be nothing if it weren&amp;#39;t for some little dance they&amp;#39;re doing so yeah there are these intense emotional Peaks all over the album but the biggest bombshell of all of them has to be the song so I which is very obviously a tribute to the late great producer and songwriter Sophie who actually collaborated with Charlie quite a few times so consistently in fact from an outside perspective I don&amp;#39;t think any fan of either Charlie or Sophie would have presumed anything of them in their connection uh other than something along the lines of hey they&amp;#39;re collaborators they have big respect for each other they love each other they&amp;#39;re probably friends Charlie Sophie Sophie Charlie name a more iconic Duo but what Charlie says on this track here actually tells a very different story and is quite revealing in a way that is actually pretty admirable because the angle of the song is yes very sad obviously but it doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily paint Charlie in the best light and again it&amp;#39;s painfully sad and uh has made me reflect on the tone that uh tributes in art or whatever other medium often take they usually end up being less about the tributed person and more about the tributor love and adoration look how great I think this person is who we all think is great and Charlie&amp;#39;s song Here does contain quite a bit of praise for Sophie that&amp;#39;s true don&amp;#39;t get me wrong but a lot of the track is actually an admittance on Charlie&amp;#39;s part with her pretty much saying uh I I was a shitty friend I kind of pushed this person away I wish I didn&amp;#39;t and now I am plagued with an insurmountable amount of regret which uh does make it a really tough listen even if I I think uh instrumentally and melodically it is one of the strongest showings here narratively and emotionally there are quite a few cuts that I think are a bit lighter in tone but they still contribute a great amount of quality to the record and are just generally fun and entertaining to listen to there&amp;#39;s Club Classics which I thought was an incredible single to the album uh also B2B which is just some very straightforward cut and dry throwback quality dance pop with a pretty clear hot and cold back and forth Love on the Rocks type narrative there&amp;#39;s also Apple which is some very groovy throwback synth pop 2 all about a situation and a dynamic that Charlie Likens to a rotten apple it&amp;#39;s a situation she describes having to escape from by car by plane there&amp;#39;s Mean Girls which is a character portrait about exactly that with a soaring and anthemic chorus plus a killer piano break that the entire track builds off of from there and then at the very end there&amp;#39;s 365 which is the this uh version of the song 360 that kicks the record off this mirrored remix as repre big finish with some acid base mixed in there for good measure so I love the way the record finishes love the way it kicks off and the flow from moment to moment generally is great it&amp;#39;s to the point where certain tracks in the leadup to the record that I thought were just kind of okay sound better being reinforced by The Vibes and Aesthetics of the surrounding songs on the album because as I&amp;#39;ve heard the entire thing now many times over I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s a skip on it the production generally goes hard as hell it is vibrant it is colorful it is very visceral at times aggressive but I could see some people kind of scratching their heads at the fact that it doesn&amp;#39;t come across quite as futuristic as uh some of those hyperpop Classics in recent years but more importantly what I think the production does on this album is that it serves the songs it&amp;#39;s sweet when it needs to be it&amp;#39;s Dynamic when it needs to be it&amp;#39;s lowkey or explosive when it needs to be and there&amp;#39;s still a very clear and consistent aesthetic focus on the entire album that centers around a certain era of pop and dance music so I&amp;#39;m not necessarily disappointed with this record not being as ahead of the curve as a project like Charlie for example especially considering that Charlie XCX copycats these days are abound the impact that people like her and Ag and Sophie have had on the modern era of pop music uh is not going any anywhere anytime soon and it&amp;#39;s with that I say I loved brat killer album and I think that this record proves that Charlie truly is a generational pop artist which is why I&amp;#39;m feeling a strong nine to a 10 on this LP transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should I review next hit the like if you like Please Subscribe please don&amp;#39;t cry hit the Bell as well over here next to my head is another video you can check out hit that up or the

    "date": "March 20, 1967",
    "genre": "Blues",
    "transcript": "oi oi pessoal eu sou o Bruno ascari esse daqui é o som de peso e para cantar Blues você precisa ter coração ao no vídeo de hoje eu quero comemorar os 55 anos de lançamento no sensacional álbum Nina Simone sings the blues um dos grandes clássicos dessa baita pianista e cantora então como de costume eu vou contar um pouquinho da história dela para depois falar sobre todas as faixas do disco então sem mais delongas vamos lá Eunice Castro Raimon muito mais conhecida como Nina Simone nasceu em 1933 e quando ela tinha ali os seus quatro anos de idade mais ou menos ela começou a tocar piano por causa da igreja em qual ela EA família frequentavam e obviamente por ser negra ela e a família também sofreram sempre muito racismo mesmo o que mais no futuro vai fazer com que a Nina seja uma figura importantíssima no movimento dos direitos civis também por ser de uma família muito humilde e almejar ser uma pianista clássica né ela fez ao e os professores diferentes e era muito caro para você poder prestar uma faculdade de música e graças a uma vaquinha ali que fizeram ela fez uma um teste na julliard anos para frente mas infelizmente acabou não passando e ela fala né várias entrevistas que ela acredita muito que era pelo fato dela ser negra também a procuração Foi gigante da família inteira porque eles tinham se mudado para Filadélfia para ela que já tava assim acreditando que ela fosse passar mesmo né e por ter sido negada a jogar um peso muito grande nas costas dela E aí depois de muitas aulas particulares em 1954 ela começa a se apresentar tocando e aí ela começa a cantar também porque pagava um pouco mais e aí ela começa a fazer apresentações de jazz e blues cantando uma outra coisa mais pop e bem de vez em quando colocando água da música clássica ali no meio é também nessa época Quando ela começa a se apresentar que o outro nome artístico de Nina Simone Nina é porque ela tinha namorado na época que chamava ela de Ninha né ou criança ou pequena e tudo e o Simone vem em homenagem à atriz francesa Simone e sim o reto na qual ela gostava demais em 1959 ela Finalmente vai lançar o primeiro disco o neuroblue um disco que vendeu muito em cima bem mas como ela tava precisando muito dinheiro na época ela acabou vendendo todos os direitos para a gravadora que era gravadora butler E aí o disco vendeu pra caramba ela ganhou ali coisa de celular quatro cinco mil dólares na época pelos direitos sendo que ela poderia ter ganhado coisa de mais de um milhão de dólares depois desse baque né financeiro ela troca de gravadora ela vai formar outra gravadora chamada Coolpix E aí vai lançar vários riscos por lá e também começa a se tornar uma hábito e nela tá sempre tocando ali no Greenwich Village que é um bairro de Nova York onde vários nomes a principalmente do funk e começaram a se apresentar Então pode Joni Mitchell o Bob Dylan entre vários e vários outros estavam ali que a Nina Simone era uma grande estrela do bairro mais para frente ela vai para outra gravadora Aí sim para Philips E aí que ela realmente começa a vender muitos e muitos discos e começa a trazer cada vez mais e começa a trazer cada vez mais as questões politizados para suas músicas especialmente sobre desigualdade e também racismo como é o caso de uma música a dela chamadas Mississippi go dizem que ela apresenta no disco Nina Simone em constante de 1964 e que ela mesma disse em entrevistas que &amp;quot;essa aqui é a minha primeira música a favor dos direitos civis A partir dessa música que outras de cunho mais politizado começa a fazer parte do seu repertório como é o caso da música ou dedicou é uma grande crítica as leis do dia entrou que realmente segregavam os Estados Unidos aquela coisa de você por exemplo entrava no ônibus e os bancos da frente eram direcionados somente e nos do fundo para os negros em 1967 ela troca mais uma vez de gravadora indo agora para RC a Victor e aí que ela vai gravar o Nina Simão de serviço de busca eu disse que a gente vai falar hoje esse aqui é um disco foi produzido pelo Danny Davis que era um menos líder em conta com um time de músicos de primeiríssima qualidade Como por exemplo o baterista o Bernardo Fure o Erick game you Rudy stivenson dividindo as guitarras o Bob bushnell no contrabaixo oboé Hilux no saxofone e na gaita e urn Reis no órgão além Claro da Grande Minas Simone nos vocais e também no piano Agora sim vamos pra primeira faixa do disco que é duas no vídeo uma música que já tem uma presença muito forte da guitarra e do contrabaixo tem uma gaita que é muito marcante também e fora a performance vocal da Nina que é excepcional com ela trazendo raiva angústia e também tristeza tudo isso misturado a letra aqui na mim e traz uma série de perguntas dela para o seu segundo marido no caso que era o Angel Street o marido extremamente abusivo que que chegou a bater nela a estuprá-la e também ameaçaram com uma arma depois amar arma na cabeça dela e nessa letra ela canta com muita tristeza e com muito desespero né através dessas perguntas se o marido dela ainda senti atração por ela seria ainda a ama então é uma letra muito pesada mesmo e ela consegue transmitir muitíssimo bem todas essas emoções na sua performance vocal então é uma música que eu chegou as pessoas achando assim que é um negócio mais romântico e tudo mais só que quando você estuda né sobre ela sobre a vida dela e essa relação terrível que ela tinha com o marido você dorme uma letra e uma música extremamente tocante que realmente assim toca a gente de ficar com bastante pena dela tá numa relação tão ruim peguei a gente muda um pouquinho o clima e vamos para uma música mais animada que se chama o site tem um baita de um grupo no contrabaixo Especialmente na bateria um dos grandes trabalhos do Bernardo por nesse disco além também de um piano muito suingado e uma sensores da guitarra que são muito legais e tem duas coisas que eu gosto duas curiosidades assim dentro dessa música que eu curto que a primeira delas é um instrumento chamado Adilson ar eu não sei a tradução disso mas seria de fato de um judeu em que é um instrumento que você põe na boca usam muito no Blue S tudo mais que ele tem um som bem característico Vocês estão vendo a foto aí e também da presença do couro que eu acredito né não tem na ficha técnica nem nada mas eu acredito que é feito pelos pelo restante dos músculos do Risco então não a cara bem diferente para esse blusa aqui para mim essa letra que traz a perspectiva feminina da relação com ela dizendo né compra para as Mulheres sempre amarem o seu o seu companheiro para encher ele sempre de beijos e que ela deve Implorar para ele não deixar a dia e noite E assim se qualquer mini Fire que entre aspas é falha que ela tenha na relação o cara vai acabar deixando ela seguindo temos a música York Um Blush bem mais lento no qual temos um trabalho excepcional do piano da guitarra e também algumas exceções bem legais da Gaita mas aqui quem realmente roubou a cena para mim é maravilhosa performance vocal da Nina ela canta com muita sensualidade com muito amor sobre uma relação não é uma relação sexual que tá acontecendo no quarto Então ela fala que eles estão ali no escuro entre as quatro paredes e tudo e que aquele algum e que o momento de alegria de felicidade da vida dela então ela quer ficar ali no escuro o máximo possível com aquela pessoa e quando tudo acaba o sol entra e tudo mais ela não vê a hora de poder revê-lo e poder realizar de novo sexo continuando vamos para faixa Will uma música que é um blush né mas há muita influência do Gospel aqui especialmente pelas progressões de acordes ali no piano é sempre uma coisa que te leva fora o trabalho do órgão das guitarras e também da presença das Palmas que realmente dá aquela impressão de missa aqui é curioso perceber a performance vocal da Nina mais uma vez muito emocionante muito entregue e é uma letra que ao mesmo tempo ela traz tristeza e também um certo desespero isso pelo menos para mim cabe muito com a letra Porque na minha interpretação ela tá falando das dúvidas do amor que ela sente está que ela tem com outro e o outro tem com ela melhor dizendo que ela não sabe se aquilo é real não então ela fica completamente perdida nisso então a letra consegue trazer muito desta carga de dúvida de Será que isso que eu tô sentindo e o outro também tá sentindo realmente amor ou é uma pura ilusão da minha cabeça que é muito interessante perceber a excepcional performance o carro dela no qual ela canta com muita tristeza com muito desespero que ela gostaria de sentir que aquele amor que ela tá vivendo naquele momento é real e aí quando você traça né o paralelo dela com casamento dela terrível que estava acontecendo na época é uma letra que quando você sabe disso ela tava doendo ainda mais em você continuando temos a faixa my Man is gone out que é uma versão da música do George gershwin lá da Ópera porgy and bess e aqui é uma versão somente com voz piano e contrabaixo tem uma música Lindíssima mesmo a performance vocal da Nina é assim excepcional de verdade as coisas mais bonitas do mundo e pelo menos para mim é a minha performance vocal preferida dela desse disco e também a faixa que eu mais gosto daqui essa aqui é uma música muitos urna e também nem triste e a letra aqui na minha interpretação fala tanto da Saudade e também dá dor de não tenho mais a pessoa que você ama ali do Oi e aí a gente pode interpretar isso de duas formas né do o homem que foi embora a gente pode interpretar isso de duas formas A primeira é que a relação deles acabou e a segunda é no caso da morte até agora encerrando lá do ar temos a música da creche Blues outra música muito politizada carreira da Nina e essa daqui é outra das minhas preferidas do disco é uma música que ela canta e critica o Governo dos Estados Unidos sobre como ele obrigava né os filhos a ir para o para Guerra do Vietnã como muitos desses jovens acabaram morrendo lá e também vai falar de várias desigualdades sociais e principalmente raciais E aí ela vai tratar vários temas como o aumento dos impostos e como todas essas coisas todas essas medidas do governo acabam afetando principalmente a população negra e Pobre dos Estados Unidos em como todas essas coisas vão aumentar a desigualdade que já e infelizmente existe até hoje aqui eu gosto muito da bateria e também da excelente guitarra mas fora isso eu quero destacar maravilhosa também performance vocal da Nina aqui é impressionante ver como ela canta com raiva com bastante ódio e traz muito enfrentamento a toda essa situação que estava acontecendo lá na época e infelizmente de novo acontece até hoje dessas medidas do governo que tá vão aumentando a desigualdade social e também racial no país agora viramos se diz que os para faixa all I want a little Sugar in my Bowl uma música que tem um trabalho muito bom no piano e também da do contrabaixo que é bem forte e aí é legal que tem um contraste interessante com a bateria aqui é bem suave e também com as inserções ali da guitarra que são muito bonitas e fora isso a música Tem um solinho bem curtinho mas que é bem legal do Saxofone aqui É legal saber que essa música é uma versão da música da da dessa Smooth que é a emitir a ver oxe E ai Boo E aí legal que o menino atrás essa diferença dentro nisso e do antes Unidos é eu preciso né de um pouco de açúcar na minha tigela e a Nina canta eu Priscila eu quero então é uma letra que ela torna um pouquinho mais feminista que a justamente essa questão é um Blues que ela vai cantar sobre essa realmente à vontade de realizar os seus desejos sexuais Então ela até canta com certa sensualidade com bastante tesão mesmo e mais na parte do fim com uma certa tristeza de infelizmente não tem isso na sua vida continuando vamos para faixa branca a música mais curtindo disco a tem menos de dois minutos de duração e aquilo que está com muito trabalho da bateria que é legal e também do órgão que vai ficar mais ao fundo mais uma vez temos uma grande interpretação da Nina dela cantando sobre a relação dela com esse tal de book né com esse cara no qual ele é muito Durão para as outras pessoas aquele cara impenetrável que está sempre bravo Olá tudo mesmo e com ela ele muda completamente sendo bom carinhoso meu amorzinho mesmo com ela continuando vamos para faixa Since I fell foi eu que é um cover da música original do Buddy Johnson e tem várias versões tem com a etta James tem que usar na Washington entre vários outros e outras logo no primeiro em um que a Nina Simone canta já que ele ia assim que arrepia o braço inteiro sobe até a nuca uma voz muito suave dela a mesma forma que ela traz muito peso para interpretação E aí quando você presta atenção no restante do instrumental a parte do piano da guitarra e até a bateria que é um pouquinho mais espaçada você realmente sente todo o peso da carga da letra no qual na minha interpretação ela tá falando mais uma vez sobre Como o relacionamento dela é abusivo em como aquele supostamente amor para somente dor e sofrimento para vida dela agora indo pra parte final do disco temos a música The House of the Rising Sun é a música que ficou famosíssima na versão do dia Animals e aqui a Nina faz uma outra versão ela já tinha gravado uma primeira vez não disco chamado Live da Vila DJ só que aqui ela faz uma versão muito mais rápida então menos para mim acaba se tornando a versão definitiva dela ok eu falei essa aqui é uma faixa que é mais agitada tanto que se você pega por exemplo o piano a a bateria eles são bem pesados mesmo é uma cara quase de ragtime então Além disso eu quero destacar bastante a gaita e obviamente a performance vocal da Nina que que nem eu falo agora pouquinho também acaba tornando essa daqui assim o cover definitivo da música na minha interpretação e pelo que eu pesquisei a letra tá falando sobre um prostíbulo que realmente existiu em Nova Orleans que se chamava né The House of the Rising Sun ou a casa do Sol Nascente que existiu entre 1862 e 1874 é mas aí a Nina muda mais uma vez a letra com quanto por exemplo a versão do M Mouse traz a visão masculina então é do cara que frequenta tanto a casa de prostituição que ele acaba gastando todo o dinheiro dele se envolvendo em bebidas em jogos e tudo mais ela vai trazer a visão feminina daquilo que ela vai trazer a versão das prostitutas que foram iludidos que foram enganadas tanto que ela fala que ela era uma moça do interior e tudo e acabou sendo enganada para ter que trabalhar naquele lugar então ela subverte a música E cria uma versão Espetacular mesmo e agora para encerrar o disco tem uns a faixa Blues for mama uma música que tem um trabalho excepcional da guitarra no piano e também do órgão que fica um pouquinho mais ao fundo a deixando a música Ainda mais forte e mais potente mas aqui Os vocais da Nina São simplesmente excepcionais mesmo ela canta com muita força com muito orgulho também sobre é uma mulher que foi deixada pelo marido é por não abaixar a cabeça para ele então o cara de subir a voz ela gritava mais alto que ele ela ameaçava bater nele quer dizer ele ameaçava bater nela e ela revidava então o cara falar você é muito encrenca acabou deixando ela ela realmente canta e mostra o conforte ela era como mulher bom se de considerações finais sem sombra de dúvida o Nina Simone sings the blues é um grande clássico mesmo seja do jazz e do blues e um dos grandes momentos da carreira da Nina Simone tem aquela frase né se é para você cantar o bruxo Você precisa cantar com coração e obviamente em claramente Nina Simone fez isso como poucos bom Pessoal esse aqui foi vídeo de hoje espero bastante que vocês tenham gostado tanto na escolha do disco quanto da análise que eu trouxe

    "transcript": "H hi everyone poony Rock Tano here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review a classic review of this Beatles album Abby rad The Beatles The Fab Four those crazy Liverpool boys John lennin Paul McCartney George Harrison Ringo Star a Beatles classic review yeah which honestly I have been putting off for years cuz classic reviews for me have always been a kind of daunting process even if it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like it to you guys uh from your perspective watching me going into it I always feel the pressure to say something uh new or interesting maybe even if I can muster it profound about these albums albums that have amassed so much cultural currency it feels almost pointless to talk about them because their presence and their influence is uh so omnipresent that it&amp;#39;s difficult to to put their cultural footprint into words it&amp;#39;s not like we&amp;#39;re staring at an animal track in the dirt uh from shoulder height no it&amp;#39;s more like we&amp;#39;re standing in a giant crater that is just so massive that collectively wear oblivious as to how far its walls stretch out talking about albums that have had that kind of impact is like describing the taste of air or a scent that you&amp;#39;ve gone nose blind to years ago and look there are a lot of artists and albums that fit this description in some way but it&amp;#39;s especially true when it comes to Abby Road oceans of Ink have been spilled about this record and the history it made it further solidified George Martin as a production Titan as it is one of the best recorded and mixed albums of all time you also have Billy Preston on this thing the legendary fifth Beetle who had some very amazing and essential organ Parts you have the renaming of the studio Studio they recorded the bulk of this album in around the mid &amp;#39;70s to reflect obviously the Beatles and the records iconic popularity you also have the gamechanging band photo on the cover too which has been copied and remixed the world over there&amp;#39;s a lot of mysterious lore around this record in some respects too like you know Paul&amp;#39;s death which was very much rumored at the time of its release and you know him being barefoot in uh the cover you also have the publisher of Chuck berries you can&amp;#39;t catch me suing John Lennon uh over kind of borrowing from Chuck&amp;#39;s lyrics and flow on the opening track come together and that&amp;#39;s just the tip of the contextual Iceberg around this project because from there you also have its musical its Sonic its artistic impact uh both long and short term as some of the heaviest moments on this record have been accredited with helping lay the ground work for metal sidebar I wouldn&amp;#39;t say this record is alone in that as you do have a you know years of hard rock uh coming out prior to this record also Jimmy hendris and heavy psych however there was something uniquely heavy about the song She&amp;#39;s So Heavy which we will get into later you&amp;#39;ve also got the legendary medal of tracks on side B of the album which of course was very art poop and very Progressive in spirit with its uh jarring multiple phases and sequences point is culturally This Record is treated like a very very very big deal and I would argue that the music on it actually lives up to the hype starting with the opening track come together a song that for many is maybe at this point overplayed and as a result of that I think some of its magic goes a little underappreciated cuz it&amp;#39;s one of the weirdest and most coldblooded blues rock songs of all time and the various Sonic parts that make it up especially in its intro moments are just iconic from that sliding Baseline the persistent percussion on Ringo&amp;#39;s part that little uh uh coming through on the vocals too the faint touches of guitar throughout the track especially on that bridge where they get a little weepy and the groove on the song just has an incredible Swagger to it Lennon spends the bulk of the track here singing about some character and his descriptions of this person range from mundane to surreal and maybe even slightly scary he says this person has a feet below his knee so what but also uh you can be held in his armchair and you&amp;#39;ll feel his disease in a way he defies description as he&amp;#39;s got to be good-looking because he&amp;#39;s so hard to see overall at least how I read it uh he&amp;#39;s trying to describe a kind of charismatic off-putting and maybe even cult-like figure and soundtracking that description uh with rock music that just frankly sounds otherworldly to the point where it&amp;#39;s difficult to imagine a live performance of it which is how I&amp;#39;ve always felt about a lot of late era Beetle stuff and of course if you want you can go online and find any number of of bands both amateur and professional uh working out their own Renditions of tracks just like this sometimes even to the point where they&amp;#39;re just like nailing every single detail but I don&amp;#39;t know for me personally when it comes to the Beatles late era stuff especially with them being such a studio animal at this point in their years of live performance kind of being behind them it&amp;#39;s just always been hard uh imagining songs like these especially this one existing in real life especially on a stage the only place I can Envision them is in this uh weird abstract imaginary space or somewhere that&amp;#39;s not quite in my Dimension but uh maybe connected to it in some way just like a slight detour off of it which I think is also the case for the following track on here though it scratches a very different emotional itch that would be the George Harrison song something which has been said by Frank Sinatra to be uh The Greatest Love Song of the past 50 or 100 years which is a tall order but certainly a compliment from a guy who made his career singing and picking songs to sing and this track to me is just love and infatuation of the highest order as Harrison says there&amp;#39;s something in the way she moves that attracts him like no other lover that&amp;#39;s it but even with that infatuation comes questions and unease as on the bridge he&amp;#39;s being asked will his love grow he doesn&amp;#39;t know he don&amp;#39;t know in fact he kind of gives this person the option to stick around and it it may show Even after this massive extravagant romantic display uh there&amp;#39;s no guarantees however I I think that&amp;#39;s just a reality of life and kind of a nice refreshing alternative from the many other love songs of the&amp;#39; 60s uh that seem to operate in this space of uh love sickness where you know you&amp;#39;re totally blind to any other uh options or maybe ups and downs that typically come with a relationship so very simple but powerful and meaningful lyrics on this track but as far as the sound of this song goes it&amp;#39;s Timeless it&amp;#39;s gorgeous the strings aren&amp;#39;t overdone they&amp;#39;re super subtle atmospheric Heavenly as well meanwhile the vocals the watery guitar bits and the organs uh they&amp;#39;re there and charming and subtly messed with in such a way where they feel just a just a tad psychedelic which again gives the track in other worldly energy like uh as come together had but again overall beautiful gorgeous song and following it uh we get another very strong tone shift I think here it&amp;#39;s important to note that at this point in the Beatles career they weren&amp;#39;t the cohesive songwriting operation that they once were in the early and mid 60s like around the release of an album like help for example in the album where their overall sound and vision was a lot more cohesive and singular and from there the band&amp;#39;s creative process evolved or maybe even devolved to the point where uh they were dropping some frankly ridiculous and uh sometimes adventurous and absurd tracks where maybe a single member was uh kind of leading the way on an odd Excursion everybody else in the group was kind of along for the ride or at least that&amp;#39;s how the Beatles creative process often can get narrativized among fans in the Press I mean for example look at how fragmented stylistically and sonically a record Like The White Album is as you get everything on that record from a birthday song to uh you know number nine number nine that album is going in so many different directions creatively it&amp;#39;s just bursting at the seams and some people say that creative disarray is uh really what led to the death of the band but at the same time for me personally that lack of creative control is part of what makes the White Album a personal favorite for me and in the case of Abby rad I think the band does a great job of making those disparate Parts come together in a harmonious fashion especially during the medley toward the end which we will get into we see flashes of these weird detours and indulgences on the following track on the aside here Maxwell&amp;#39;s Silver Hammer which is a Paul McCartney track that is uh theatrical and uh you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a piano tune that is the definition of j it has some nice touches of brass as well it&amp;#39;s tracks like this that make me raise an eyebrow at the fact that John Lenin was the one who was couched as The Artsy little weirdo in the band meanwhile Here Comes Paul who&amp;#39;s going to write a song about a guy going on a murder spree with a hammer literally as his victims are uh a woman he took out on a date a teacher and uh the judge at his trial whose deaths are all described against these cutesy little bang bang sound effects in the mix and uh super celebratory choruses too it is a beautiful but also ridiculous tribute to a total who Paul can&amp;#39;t even keep himself from laughing at how Preposterous his own story is at one point on a Lyrica cuz you can hear him like giggling to himself as he&amp;#39;s singing moving on from here in the track list though we are still very much in Paul territory cuz we get o Darlin which is is a big Paul ballad we got to have a big ballad we got to do a big soul number where he&amp;#39;s yelling his brains out which for me can go one of two ways sometimes with Paul doing this you will get a mix of Madness and genius like in the case of Helter Skelter and sometimes it can get a little too cartoony or feel like a bad impression of a different singer like in the case of a track like a why don&amp;#39;t we do it in the road and in the case of O Darlin it&amp;#39;s a little bit more of the latter sometimes I wish Paul just sang in more of a regular register with uh this one and focused more on keeping his baselines in check cuz there&amp;#39;s clearly a note that comes in late around 1:29 on the song keeping that lined up nice would be a lot better than you know overselling the damn tune however I do admire his passion on the song his desperation is certainly palpable and I do admire the band for playing the hell out of the damn thing the drums the pianos and the squawking Rhythm guitars are all punching the mix as loud and as hard as possible I&amp;#39;m surprised it sounds as balanced as it does then following this it&amp;#39;s Ringo time with Octopus&amp;#39;s Garden and frankly you got to give the guy some credit on this one not just for how cute it is but after his most well-known song being about a yellow submarine you would imagine that he might have like some reservations about doing another track that&amp;#39;s nautical in any way whatsoever but no my dude actually just really wants to hang out under the ocean in in Octopus&amp;#39;s Garden in fact totally Carefree in the shade warm and hiding away from storms it&amp;#39;s just sweet precious escapism with sunny vocal harmonies bright pianos and of course bubbles with a finish that has almost like a country twang to it after this we have the finish of the aside with I want you sheis so heavy which is an aching longing fiery blues rock tune that has these hellish transitions into some super Sinister guitar passages uh just fiery fiery fiery organ hits from Billy Preston some of his solo runs too on the track are insane and throughout the song we kind of switch back and forth uh between what sounds like a very sensual very lowkey uh but still Moody Rock tune into these heavier darker more Sinister doomy and lumbering Rock passages that uh the more we kind of switch over to that dark side the more expansive they get the bigger they get the longer we&amp;#39;re kind of hanging in that space uh that is until these sections just totally take over and repeat to the point where they&amp;#39;re just getting heavier and thicker and louder and more crushing and more oppressive and more suffocating the guitars and bass are getting bigger and bigger and bigger and filling up uh all of the empty space you have like this uh Moog synth just making all of this just windy staticky noise it&amp;#39;s filling up the background too more layers more volume more verb it&amp;#39;s just uh really kind of uh looming it&amp;#39;s becoming just uh so monolithic and just Mass frankly it&amp;#39;s sounding more and more metal more and more hellish and then after a while it just kind of cuts off it&amp;#39;s just brutal absolutely brutal just cutting it off it&amp;#39;s just over it&amp;#39;s just done which uh was was certainly a bold choice for its time and uh in an instance of amazing sequencing we go over to the bside on the record uh where the first thing we hear is George Harrison&amp;#39;s Here Comes the Sun we are going from this cold uh apocalyptic heavy Rock sound to something that is Plucky and acoustic and pretty and bright and uh good feeling it is dazzling it is sparkling and in so many ways quintessentially Beatles with its vocal harmonies and its hopeful energy which somehow manages to increase as the song progresses and again it feels like another song on this album that doesn&amp;#39;t exist in the same reality as me I mean to to compare it to a sunrise I think is obvious and uh kind of corny uh what sort of makes it difficult to kind of see this song in the same world as me is that I can&amp;#39;t imagine somebody writing it uh that lives on this planet too that is so dying and cold and nasty and disgusting even during the cultural era that it came out of uh I could only imagine to track uh this positive and this frankly nice coming from a world that doesn&amp;#39;t know the Pains of this one and yet George Harrison uh still wrote this track and it still kind of rose up out of the concrete uh like a flower like a rose for another corny cliche ass analogy now from here we get the song Because which uh kind of kicks off the medal on uh the record cuz if you&amp;#39;re not familiar in the second half of this LP uh we don&amp;#39;t have a whole lot of very fulllength complete songs with very defined structures beginnings and ends uh rather we are getting these short Motif or you know vignette type pieces that segue into one another or introduce each other reference back sometimes too and not too long prior to this the band had flirted with songs that have more experimental or linear structures but this is the first time that they really like extended it out for the length of an entire you know side of a record which was certainly an ambitious feet and uh one that to this day is held in very high regard which is what makes this LP so special but yeah to go back to because another quintessentially Beatles moment with these wintry and gorgeous and surreal and stacked vocal Harmony without overe explaining this track it is mystifying and ends on a bit of a cliffhanger because it does in a way feel like a tone Setter for the following track You Never Give Me Your Money which starts like your typical sad little Paul McCartney piano ballad with lyrics that treat love like it&amp;#39;s a financial mediation of some sort and while it is on the long side in comparison with some of the other tracks on the second half of this record it still feels just as fragmented as from here you kind of jump into a bit of cartoony piano Rock more psych pop with super Grand vocal harmonies as well as another instrumental shift where you get these heartening little vocal passages uh uh with the group singing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7even oh God&amp;#39;s children go to heaven it&amp;#39;s kind of like you&amp;#39;re getting several songs in one here and past this point things kind of speed up in terms of uh the tone shifts in between tracks and how quickly we&amp;#39;re moving from one moment to the next you have Sun King which feels very much like a warm guitar Oasis which George Harrison would say in an interview was at least in part inspired by an instrumental track that Fleetwood Mack had dropped around that time Albatross but yeah overall this is very much a piece of sunshine psych with pretty building vocals and keys and uh toward the end uh this kind of weird jargony fake Spanish section that again feels like the band doing anything to avoid sounding regular and nor noral and just in touch with reality after this it is an over switch up it is a hard and jarring change with Mean Mr Mustard a silly piano tune that is a character portrait about a guy that&amp;#39;s a real bastard mentions his sister Pam who is clearly being referenced in the following track as well as her taking him to see the queen uh which is why it&amp;#39;s sort of understandable narratively why in the original sort of like composition of this medal piece her majesty the final song on this record was actually in this section you can actually hear the first chord that plays on her majesty is actually the last chord on Mean Mr Mustard but apparently that got snipped out and moved toward the very end and instead at the very end of Mr Mustard uh we get the first chord on polythene Pam which in its own right like Mean Mr Mustard is another odd character portrait or description of sorts talking about this person saying she&amp;#39;s a woman but she looks like a man and have you seen her in Drag it&amp;#39;s a very genderbent moment where the most complimentary thing said about this person is that she&amp;#39;s attractively built meanwhile she came in through the bathroom window as a much more Dancy and a luxurious tone shift uh narratively it&amp;#39;s not explicitly said whether or not we&amp;#39;re singing about a different person than Pam here per se so in a way I guess you could read it as such even though it is said uh that uh it&amp;#39;s a very real and different experience uh from Paul that actually inspired this one but yeah this this one&amp;#39;s a very groovy number after which we actually get a pretty big amount of space uh kind of a breather where the medley takes a very theatrical turn really feels like it breaks off a bit but there are still uh some key call backs to earlier on the record with golden slumbers we get this very big dramatic showing of strings and horns and pianos for a lullabi that is described in the lyrics but never really quite happens I mean it is gorgeous and it is powerful but I would be pretty angry if PA McCartney uh went through all of this trouble to set up a lullabi only for him to uh kind of lead into boy you&amp;#39;re going to carry that weight carry that weight thanks man going to doze right off to this one but yeah with the following carry that weight you get this immense and amazing big chorus group vocal passage as well as a melodic repre that goes back to you never give me your money toward the very end some guitar bits that reference back to to Sun King and with the end we just have a a powerful rocking fun finisher with a dueling guitar solo bits there&amp;#39;s confetti flying people are dancing in the street and then we kind of get this heavenly Ascent of vocals and keys that bring things to a very bright and warm place then once this closes up again we hear that kind of big cord crash at the start of her majesty uh and then there&amp;#39;s a little acoustic Diddy with some fingerpick guitar some strumming um lyrics that are yes about uh her majesty and sing about her in a very loving but also kind of a reverent way like I want to tell her that I love her a lot but I got to get a belly full of wine Her Majesty is a pretty nice gal someday I&amp;#39;m going to make her mine very cheeky and and silly way to uh end off your over-the-top and amazingly produced art poop Opus and in a nutshell yeah that&amp;#39;s pretty much what Abby Road is and frankly that&amp;#39;s why I love it and there you go that&amp;#39;s my review my classic review of this album transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would

    "transcript": "hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a nice sweet classic review of Bob Dylan&amp;#39;s highway 61 revisited this is the sixth full-length LP from mr. Robert Alan Zimmerman aka Bob Dylan a significant record for modern music as well as this contemporary folk singers discography for a few reasons for one one of his most seminal hits is on this record like a rolling stone this album also featured one of the most heart-wrenching moments and popular music Ballad of a Thin Man and this is also the record where from front to back nearly Dillon went electric meaning he was backing his singing his harmonica and guitar playing on this LP with electric guitars with drums rock instrumentation a handful of rock musicians were actually brought in to perform in the sessions on this record this is something that in the past Dylan had only flirted with be it in the live setting or on his last full-length LP we&amp;#39;re only half of the album featured rock instrumentation on it while the other half was acoustic folky and dipping his toes into this pool wasn&amp;#39;t something Bob Dylan&amp;#39;s fans all accepted mostly because his popularity had been born out of the folk music revival of the 60s specifically in Greenwich Village New York where Bob Dylan would routinely perform if you want to read more about this era of his life you should actually pick up the book Bob Dylan Chronicles Volume one I don&amp;#39;t know where the next two chronicles are been waiting ten years but if you are a Bob Dylan fan or if you&amp;#39;re even just slightly interested in this era of music he tells some you know very interesting war stories about himself other artists that he played alongside in this area and just you know this is this early part of his life now at the time this new wave of folk music you could call it wasn&amp;#39;t just about celebrating new folk music singers it was also about sort of maintaining an American folk tradition Dylan in his years and most likely even today was obsessed with American folk singer Woody Guthrie he had this incredible reverence for him as did a lot of fans of Dylan&amp;#39;s early work so for Dylan to go for making these socially aware politically charged acoustic ballads on a record like the times they are a-changin to going with rock instrumentation on highway 61 revisited it&amp;#39;s not hard to see that some fans would kind of think he&amp;#39;s going astray and losing the narrative of this folk music revival and it was not just the inclusion of electric guitar that were turning some fans off Dylan&amp;#39;s lyrics at this point in his career seemed way less tangible seemed way less real his lyrics turned more abstract and surreal he was taking less direct jabs at politicians and instead was providing listeners with this kind of colorful strange beautiful and sometimes unsettling imagery but when you read further into verses on this record and later records as well it wasn&amp;#39;t really that Dylan&amp;#39;s stopped paying attention to the world around him but I think his critiques on the world at large just became a little bit more subtle even though for some this LP might have been a hard pill to swallow at the time this is ultimately the move that needed to be made not only for Dylan&amp;#39;s career but for modern music in general because not only is this a great LP but this album helped solidify folk rock as an art form before this album there were certainly examples of folk rock music take a band like the animals for example which were taking a very popular British Invasion type rock sound for its time and applying that to the traditional folk song House of the Rising Sun or even the birds who the same year that Bob Dylan came out with bringing it all back home came out with a single cover version of mr. Tambourine Man and that song was a huge hit for the Byrds it wasn&amp;#39;t even a single originally from Dylan&amp;#39;s album but it was a huge single for the birds the birds actually named their debut LP after that single it&amp;#39;s such a sugary pop rock version and they tried to do the same thing with the song the times they are a-changin on their next full-length album which you might remember also features the song didn&amp;#39;t and so let&amp;#39;s just say that the fusions of funk and rock music up until this point we&amp;#39;re sort of more on the pop rock side at the time though let&amp;#39;s not ignore the fact that rhythm in blues is kind of like an early version of folk rock anyway I mean we have the blues which is a style of American folk music that was then given electric guitars and you have rhythm in blues but rhythm and blues eventually gave way to rock and roll deeper into the 50s and then it sort of lost a little bit more touch with its blues roots in the 60s as we got pop rock and psychedelic rock and then at this time we have people sort of thinking like hey what&amp;#39;s this folk stuff we forgot about it&amp;#39;s so awesome and this is about the time that you had Dylan over here taking the new contemporary sounds of rock music and studio production and combining them with the old organic route seer sounds of this recently rediscovered American folk music on this LP Dylan didn&amp;#39;t just want to take these folk songs and apply them to just popular flavor of the month pop rock instrumentation he wanted to bring in piano and organ in that rock ensemble while staying in touch with those folk and blues music roots as in touch with that as you could be for the mid 60s but referencing and pulling from these traditions is also the point of the title of this record Dylan sort of sees highway 61 on this album as kind of this I guess main vein through these cultural landmarks for him in America you know where you can kind of head from the the Midwest where he was raised to the south which was the birthplace of a lot of very important folk music and blues for Dylan and that sort of live in the moment roots II organic feel that you get out of folk music is very much on full display on this recording there is tons of just ambient sound surrounding the drums drums are loud but they don&amp;#39;t really sound like they&amp;#39;re miked all that close either the guitars are just noisy they are just strung out the harmonicas are very bright they&amp;#39;re shrill the bass is just kind of clunky the acoustic guitars are just strummed very chaotically this is an incredibly raw and blemished recording for its time with the exception of the opening track which was actually produced by Tom Wilson who produced the last Bob Dylan album for the rest of this LP Dylan actually works with producer Bob Johnston who he pulls together just a much more coarse sound which actually continues a bit onto Dylan&amp;#39;s next full-length LP blonde on blonde which is my favorite record in his discography you can actually hear a very clear difference between the way that like Rolling Stone and the rest of the tracks on this LP are performed recorded and assembled I mean by comparison like a rolling stone the drums are much quieter they&amp;#39;re much more finely produced and just the whole thing instrumentally is much more cleanly assembled than the rest of the record here I know it probably all just sounds like 60 [ __ ] to us because we&amp;#39;re so far away from this era but there&amp;#39;s a very fine subtle stylistic details between Wilson and Johnston&amp;#39;s production styles on this LP not that it really takes away from the album because like a rolling stone is fantastic song but then compare that to the very next song on this album tombstone blues we have the most cleanly assembled track right next to one of the most chaotic songs on the entire record tombstone blues in my opinion has one of the most wacked-out drum beats to ever be on a record from an artist this big for their time it&amp;#39;s just this booming bass drum and this crashing cymbal and snare being hit at the same time driving very fast really propelling this song at a very quick speed this track feels like just a very very fast drive down a dusty highway the Sun is beating down on you sand in your face you&amp;#39;re on the verge of a sunburn for me this song is as proto-punk if not more proto-punk than any kink single they came out with in the mid or late 60s and you know considering how much of a direct in influence this album had on guys like we read you know Velvet Underground there&amp;#39;s really nothing more proto-punk than influencing the Velvet Underground is there no however even though the song is kind of punky kind of Rocky it still keeps in touch with those folk and blues traditions again which is the point of this record we have like a rolling stone which features electric guitar feature some sweet organs a nice drumbeat and iconic chorus as well as theme melody some very catchy catchy harmonica playing and some lyrics that are kind of abstract but when you read into them a little bit more deeply it&amp;#39;s kind of like a fall from grace for someone who used to be I guess kind of in the lap of luxury I guess sort of privilege but then one day they kind of wake up and find themselves on the verge of homelessness or just kind of homeless someone who kind of has the world turned over on its head for them someone who now has to figure out how to live life from scratch and Dylan singing on this track is so passionate it&amp;#39;s overwhelming as he&amp;#39;s singing how does it feel he&amp;#39;s calling out so I guess you could say aggressively with so much energy that it&amp;#39;s almost as if he expects like an answer back then as I said we have the song tombstone blues which features these rambling scrawled lyrics they seem kind of chaotic and just manically delivered but they are very pointed and very smart lyrics just delivered over this very chaotic noisy full crack instrumentation and as the song goes along we get this imagery of American heroes like Paul Revere or guys like Jack the Ripper at the head of the Chamber of Commerce we&amp;#39;re also getting insane depictions of religious figures as well as politicians and while all of this chaos is going on we have the refrain of the track talking about just average everyday people living through destitution no shoes no food while all of this chaos at the top of the power pyramid is going on everyone down at the bottom is suffering again even though Dylan isn&amp;#39;t being like you know politicians politicians usings you me this that everything he&amp;#39;s not making such bold playing statements but he&amp;#39;s still saying something and in addition to tombstone blues we have other tracks on here that are similarly chaotic folk rock songs with these rambling lyrics the track from a Buick six or the title track off of this LP things settle down a little bit on the next song it takes a lot to laugh it takes a train to cry we get some nice blues piano on this song and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just a beautiful little tune and a bit of a reminder of sort of that blues tradition not only because of the the flavor and the melodies on the piano of this track but also just transman trains I mean to blues music trains were such an integral thing not only in terms of spreading the music but I mean trains at that time when the Blues were kind of coming into formation was just a way of life a necessity for travel so you know it&amp;#39;s just funny to think of how little trains there are in music now just so few trains and we also have some ballads in the track listing here to like Ballad of a Thin Man which is just so depressing not even from a lyrical standpoint just the sound of this instrumental from the kind of plinky saloon style piano just very sad chords and melodies and the organ embellishments on this track too and Dylan&amp;#39;s singing is just so pained on this song or just kind of like kind of like he&amp;#39;s a I don&amp;#39;t know being this voice of reason who might have warned the the protagonists of this track at one time and now he&amp;#39;s kind of there to be like I told you so I told you so and this song is a lot like the opening track on here where we kind of have a figure driving the song who sort of seems to be wealthy not in money but sort of in connections or knowledge and perception and understanding and now he is put into a position where the world just no longer makes sense and Bob Dylan paints this picture with a ton of just confusing surreal imagery later in the tracklisting hear the song just like Tom them blues lyrically is equally surreal but the instrumental backdrop of this track is just so much warmer so much less depressing and the very somber delicate and quiet closer on here an acoustic track Desolation Row is a very wonderful and warm finish to this record which is a pretty turbulent emotional experience from very fiery aggressive highs to just sad down in the dumps lows the track is 11 minutes long it really glides things out gently really kind of you know coasts you down from the insanity of the previous eight tracks and Dylan makes a series of just surreal and abstract lyrical points with pretty much every verse here the guitars on this tractor sound absolutely gorgeous and you know there&amp;#39;s not really anything else I feel like I can say about these tracks or this album I guess I really haven&amp;#39;t gone that much into Dylan&amp;#39;s vocal style but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just such an established sound that you know I don&amp;#39;t really know if I need to go that deep into it hey that&amp;#39;s really more of a parody personally Dylan&amp;#39;s kind of throaty who focal x&amp;#39; have been a turn-off for some but maybe I&amp;#39;ve kind of found them to be more tuneful than others do and I just find his delivery even when he&amp;#39;s kind of doing this talk singing thing to be incredibly captivating and expressive as well as I guess kind of riveting I mean everything he says and this is partially not just because of his his vocal delivery but the quality of his lyrics too but I just find myself hanging on every single word he says and that&amp;#39;s pretty much why this album is fantastic if you give this LP you listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why transition a hey yo what up you&amp;#39;re the best forever"

    "transcript": "Frank Sapp hi everyone Anthony fantano here internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review continuing reviews of some of my favorite albums ever Classics if you want to use the cord this is not going to be a regular segment I&amp;#39;m only doing it for this week my heart is just not into constantly reviewing older albums I&amp;#39;d much rather focus on new stuff because that&amp;#39;s what I cares about the mostest I respect the past but I don&amp;#39;t live in it however there&amp;#39;s no reason we can&amp;#39;t you know do this just right now to celebrate 50k so to continue this week I would love to talk about about the Frank Zappa album hot rats Frank Zappa guitarist composer singer Rock icon and musical eccentric any conversation focusing on the weirder side of American music should at least mention Frank Zappa for sure not only has the guy written a plethora a plethora of experimental music over the course of his career but there are some serious musical chops to be found in his discography but I think the most memorable attribute Zappa had to offer in his music was definitely his personality when I think of Frank Zappa&amp;#39;s personality and how it fits into his music it&amp;#39;s almost as if a musician from the 2000s had got transported back to the 1960s and 7s because of the sheer level of self-awareness that Zappa put into his music he was a guy that just loved to make fun of everything including what he did for a living He laced his humor and his worldview in his music at just about every opportunity that he could Zappa&amp;#39;s music poked fun at hippies in the 60s on the seminal album were only in it for the money and less than 10 years later on zoo allures he was making fun of the Disco set and his other albums are also loaded with jokes about Teen Angst and love and sex and rock and roll as well as Fame and societal norms however hot rats is where a lot of the joking gets kind of cast aside in order to create a a set of mostly instrumental and exceptional Jazz Rock and jazz fusion songs which may be the most widely admired and known in the genre Zappo was not the only guy playing with these ideas at the time though he had plenty of contemporaries fusing Jazz with rock Funk and avangard composition like Miles Davis Santana Herby Hancock let&amp;#39;s not forget the soft machine as well as one of my all-time favorites the Maha Vishnu Orchestra but Zappa&amp;#39;s Jazz Rock tracks have a much different attitude than the songs that those artists were were putting together I know I said on this record earlier the joking kind of gets put aside but the sound the style the the feelings that get conveyed on this album are so much brighter and more fun and kookier in comparison to those artists which is not usually something Rock and especially Jazz fans smile upon since Jazz and rock are really deep and really serious genres of music but Zappa&amp;#39;s compositional chops and his his playing on this record are so great it&amp;#39;s hard not to admire what&amp;#39;s going on here on at least some level if you don&amp;#39;t come away from hot rats loving the entire album I think at least the first track is is worth loving or maybe liking this song Peaches in regalia starts with a rush of piano chords and what kind of sounds like speedily tremolo picked guitar leads I&amp;#39;m not completely sure how that sound is created to be quite honest I know in the past Zappa has experimented with recording guitar solos to tape and then altering the speed of the tape in order to get an interesting effect I&amp;#39;m not sure if that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on here but whatever it is it&amp;#39;s a really interesting sound and gives peaches a flavor that right after this introductory moment brass and Woodwinds kind of fly in and it&amp;#39;s not like there&amp;#39;s any instrument in this spot that hasn&amp;#39;t been on another record clarinet saxophone that sort of thing but the way they&amp;#39;re kind of pancaked onto one another it creates an interesting sound an interesting tone it&amp;#39;s almost as if one instrument is creating this sound and it just ends up being so memorable because of that because of how strange and odd the instruments feel on here and of course Zappa&amp;#39;s unique approach to writing Melodies only helps that after this some flute and keyboard and guitar kind of alternate for the soloing Spotlight on this track and then just before the 2-minute mark there&amp;#39;s just this Jubilee of of bright bright horns that are just so triumphant they come off as being equal parts beautiful and quirky with a really close listen it becomes kind of apparent that this song is really really composed very planned out but it&amp;#39;s great because Zappa and the musicians he brought on to this record jam it out so fluidly it&amp;#39;s almost as if it&amp;#39;s just stream of Consciousness this song is definitely a noticeable peak in the Z Zappa discography in this album it&amp;#39;s really Zappa&amp;#39;s compositional side at its sharpest after the opener things get dirtier looser more kind of jammed out if you&amp;#39;re expecting you know one kind of meticulously composed Jazz Rock Opus after another you&amp;#39;re just not going to get that the rest of the tracks on here have spots that are clearly planned out too just like peaches especially the song son of Mr Green jeans which is almost the the cousin to peaches but most of the remaining songs on here are much longer because they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re stretched out with solos and improvs and that&amp;#39;s great for jazz fans and people who love jazz fusion and guitar heroism but maybe not for people who love their songs short sweet simple to the point still I like all the songs following the opener on this thing and the grittiest of all of them comes right after the opener Willie The Pimp which features the gravel voice was Captain beefart a predecessor to Tom weights and he is not shy on this track at all sort of lyrically painting this image of a pimp and shouting and shrieking all over this track like he&amp;#39;s really causing a ruckus and just the the groove and the solos just the jam of this track just feels so low down and and dirty this track is about as filthy as a wh house mattress I would say and there&amp;#39;s this really sleazy fiddle playing all over this song which really brings that attitude home things head back in the direction of refinement on the song the son of Mr Green jeans which like I said is heavily layered and orchestrated just like peaches and regalia but on this song things really get stretched out with a lot of strong soloing and Zappa&amp;#39;s playing is just so great on this track I can&amp;#39;t help but eat up every note he was just such a great player the guitar was almost an extension of him you can really kind of dive into what he&amp;#39;s playing and think about it and see that it&amp;#39;s thoughtful but it&amp;#39;s so fast and fluid it&amp;#39;s almost as if it had no planning or forethought whatsoever following that song is little umbrellas which because of its lack of just blaring guitar solos is almost just a legit jazz song Simply Jazz not Jazz Rock almost a jazz song because this track is mostly made of composed moments my one real annoyance with this album is that I feel like little umbrellas could have been so much longer if it had been jammed out this song really isn&amp;#39;t as stretched out as it could be and I think it&amp;#39;s worth stretching out because the feeling of this track is so much different than the other songs it&amp;#39;s more chilled out it kind of lurches forward in this really kind of sad and mysterious way I&amp;#39;d say it&amp;#39;s a lovable monstrosity but the lack of strong soloing on that song is made up for on the next track here that song is gumbo variations where Ian Underwood whips out his most fiery performance yet on this album his sax screams for mercy on this song this thing is a 17 minute long combo of jazz funk and rock all the composing and all the planning sort of gets thrown to the curb as saxophone violin and guitar just play so hard that even I get sweaty the closer it must be a camel kind of sends things off on a really weird note saxophones and drums kind of hit these syncopated angular Jagged Melodies it&amp;#39;s twice the monstrosity of little umbrellas and has a lot more beef to it as well I would just like to say I love the hell out of this album and hot rats is just a standout moment in not just the Zappa discography but in jazz fusion and Jazz Rock in general I wouldn&amp;#39;t say other albums in this style are inferior definitely not but this is one of the only albums that I know that combines Jazz and rock with these really colorfully eccentric compositions so if you really value a strong personality unique Melody writing Jazz this may become a classic for you just as it is for me this thing is definitely one of my my favorites and probably will be for the foreseeable future and now cuch chesta hey everybody uh C chesta here uh Frank zapper cooking up hat dags in just 30 seconds flat delish uh however I am not much for hot rats or cold rats I don&amp;#39;t really care what the temperature is only good rat&amp;#39;s a dead rat am I right but uh in summation whatever Anthony was saying you should listen to over there you should probably listen to it it&amp;#39;s uh listening full in your ears forever [Music]"

    "transcript": "what&amp;#39;s going on people Mike see town here with another episode of out of my element where you guys get to pick the albums that I review and today is a special one guys yeah so the wear of this most recent poll is Charles Mingus the black saint and the sinner lady and what is so special about this this the first jazz album that has won this poll and I&amp;#39;ve said before jazz is like the only genre that I really don&amp;#39;t know much about at all I&amp;#39;ve listened to a few people here and there I have a couple of Records but not many and you know a lot of different music was played in my house when I was growing up but believe it or not from what I remember jazz isn&amp;#39;t really one of them there was a bit of Ramsey Lewis trio here and there some some Miles Davis of course but that&amp;#39;s kind of it so I&amp;#39;ve been really curious about jazz for a really long time but it&amp;#39;s one of those genres where it&amp;#39;s kind of daunting and a little bit intimidating to try to figure out where to start and I know a couple of homies out there y&amp;#39;all know what I&amp;#39;m talking about I&amp;#39;ve tried to throw out some suggestions but I don&amp;#39;t know I just never never got around to it plus I would pick an artists and I would go through a couple other albums and you know some of them I would think were really cool and then I&amp;#39;d hear like three more albums that I didn&amp;#39;t really like at all so the genre as a whole just never really sucked me into it when I started this series jazz was actually one of the things that I really had in mind as far as delving into and I&amp;#39;d mentioned a ton of times that I didn&amp;#39;t know much about jazz so it&amp;#39;s kind of crazy that it took this long for you guys to actually vote a jazz album to the top but we are here and I&amp;#39;m stoked now while not super familiar with jazz I am familiar with Charles Mingus I know that&amp;#39;s kind of disappointing for some of you guys but um yeah I&amp;#39;d seen that documentary on him that came out a while ago and I found him to be just a fascinating character and I get hyped on that Zack Daly Roca line on the run the jewels album where he says I&amp;#39;m Charlie Mingus dumping through the ceiling master pain on these lost European Steven if you watch that documentary that line will make a lot more sense to you but yeah this album the black saint and the sinner lady this is recorded released in 1963 and is heralded as one of megasis best works and i&amp;#39;d heard bits and pieces of it because of the documentary but i never actually sat down and listened to the entire thing before until now now i&amp;#39;m totally new when it comes to talking about this genre of music so i&amp;#39;m not quite sure how this video is gonna go you know not to sound pretentious or anything but it&amp;#39;s very rare that I&amp;#39;m called to talk about a genre of music that I&amp;#39;m really just not comfortable with at all you know but  it so yeah so this album it&amp;#39;s broken into four tracks but divided into different movements the way a ballet is which he did intentionally which i think is really dope but now from the moment this started I was really sucked in I like the tension that builds at the beginning of the first track it really sounds like you&amp;#39;re on a trip somewhere like you can almost visualize like being on a boat or something like rough waters you know then the calm like that&amp;#39;s what I feel when I listen to this as it moves into this frantic moment with the drums kind of doing their own thing then it kind of levels out then towards the end of this track it&amp;#39;s interesting how there&amp;#39;s essentially so much going on at the same time but instead of just chaos it comes across as this beautiful arrangement that really takes you into your head man and at one point around the 5 and a half minute mark it&amp;#39;s almost like there are multiple solos happening at the same time and it&amp;#39;s really it&amp;#39;s really a cool feeling the second track begins with this piano that sounds really sad and sultry at the same time once the horns weave their way in then around the the three and a half minute mark it just starts to get crazy at this moment it sounds like the horns are all doing their own thing as the drums start to get more more anxious and the composition here gets more and more exciting before there&amp;#39;s a slight quiet moment before everything comes back together onto the same kind of mellow ish beat it&amp;#39;s such a cool cool track the third track is really cool the way it comes in again with these sad piano sounds then the horns kind of come in without warning then they go away again then they give more way to the piano and once the horns come back it&amp;#39;s this it&amp;#39;s this really beautiful sound here but it totally threw me off when the flamenco guitar came in which was played beautifully and skillfully it just wasn&amp;#39;t something that I was expecting on an album like this but it actually worked out beautifully to the point where I actually wanted it to stay a lot longer than it did but at the same time I also get that it felt like this sort of transition to the next part of the track which was just really really well done the fourth and last track is actually a really cool one because it kind of plays with ideas that were done on the previous tracks and I like that the flamenco guitar makes another appearance on this song but this time it stretched out a little bit more but around four minutes into the track it just gets Apes it and I don&amp;#39;t know man this might be my favorite part of the entire album there&amp;#39;s a whole lot of going on it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s frantic it&amp;#39;s all over the place then it kind of breaks into this quiet piano part for a moment that&amp;#39;s once again very sad very somber then this flute comes in that sounds like something that that Comus would have done on first utterance and it&amp;#39;s just beautiful man throughout the 20-minute track they go all over the place giving you so many different ideas so many so many things coming in and out just like a rollercoaster of emotions and I haven&amp;#39;t read too much about this album so I&amp;#39;m not positive about the details concerning the story that they were maybe trying to tell here I read that it&amp;#39;s about people who are mistreated in their country and the whole background surrounding that but I don&amp;#39;t really know much more than that I need to look into it at any rate it certainly feels like this could be the soundtrack to a movie with no dialogue you know if you got the right actors I feel like you could easily tell exactly what emotion they were trying to convey with the sounds coming from this album and I&amp;#39;m definitely gonna be checking out some more of this stuff man because I just love it but yeah this was my first traditional jazz review and I thoroughly enjoyed it man reading about how Charles Mingus used eleven different musicians who all play different but really important roles into this album it&amp;#39;s really really interesting this was something pretty rare during the time that this came out and the fact that instead of just leaving it the way it was but should probably still be just awesome to listen to he actually went back and applied a lot of overdubbing to the tracks which is another thing that was unheard of at the time of this album&amp;#39;s recording and the whole idea that the liner notes were written maybe by someone that could have been going through a manic episode at the time it&amp;#39;s something that also comes through in the music if you kind of have that information before consuming the album I find the fact that there were also sections written by Mingus &amp;#39;as psychologists explaining you know kind of where his head may have been when he was composing these songs the whole lore of this album is just as interesting as the music itself to me but overall I really enjoyed this album this is something that I would definitely return to and I kind of have more of an understanding as to why metal dudes love this kind of I have an understanding of why a lot of avant-garde experimental noise artists might really like this kind of thing because it&amp;#39;s so free and it&amp;#39;s kind of limitless you know and it&amp;#39;s kind of taking the whole idea of music and its structure and it&amp;#39;s flipping it on its head or it&amp;#39;s totally saying it all together you know but uh yeah I think however I like jazz with vocals a little bit more like the America Dombey and elders owns album that came out this year I think that&amp;#39;s amazing fat Kelin filled current album African skies that came out a while ago that  is just amazing I&amp;#39;m still getting acclimated and familiar with this type of music and I&amp;#39;ve listened to a few I won&amp;#39;t say which ones because I don&amp;#39;t want to spoil it in the event that you guys do vote for them in the future but but I&amp;#39;ll say I had a feeling that a jazz album would eventually win and I couldn&amp;#39;t be happier with the one that did so thank you guys for voting this up I&amp;#39;m really happy with this hopefully you guys enjoyed my jazz virginal ass talking about this in the most unconventional and babbling play possible but um yeah I don&amp;#39;t know the the new poll for the next video is in the description section down there let&amp;#39;s do it vote on it get on it and if you want to be someone that can actually add choices to the poll become a patron you can do it for as little as a dollar a month alright so that&amp;#39;s it for this video hopefully you guys enjoyed it as usual thank you for living thank you for love and thank for being you and I&amp;#39;ll see you guys next time and if this is uploaded on Christmas which I plan bah  humbug peace out boy [Music]"

the world at what he did and what he did was sing songs about love throughout the 1960s gay rose to fame as one of motown records biggest stars by 1969 he had cracked the usrnb top 10 charts 25 times and even topped the pop charts with i heard it through the grapevine his delicate voice was perfect for singing about romance and heartbreak and he became one of the most important cogs in the musical machine that was motown records but while gay&amp;#39;s career was taking off his life and the world around him were falling apart for marvin gaye fame brought with it a deep depression and a serious addiction to cocaine on top of this gay&amp;#39;s career took a shocking turn in 1967 when his singing partner tammy terrell collapsed on stage from a brain tumor she would die three years later and as gay was dealing with this personal trauma his country was going through trauma as well the vietnam war loomed over a generation of youth and black america&amp;#39;s civil rights movement was being met with violent resistance at every turn in 1965 the movement lost one of its greatest leaders in malcolm x and then three years later martin luther king jr was assassinated as well a year after that the fbi broke into activist fred hampton&amp;#39;s house at four in the morning and murdered him in his sleep this hatred and violence had an effect on marvin gaye what was a singer supposed to do in the face of such pain and injustice how could you sing love songs when the government was violently repressing its own people as early as 1965 gay was starting to question his role as a musician and public figure he told his biographer that these thoughts came as a result of seeing la&amp;#39;s watts riots my stomach got real tight and my heart started beating like crazy i wanted to throw the radio down and burn all the [ __ ] songs i&amp;#39;d been singing and get out there and kick ass with the rest of the brothers i wonder to myself with the world exploding around me how am i supposed to keep singing love songs but barry gordy who ran motown records with an iron fist had a strict policy against artists taking political stances and so it wasn&amp;#39;t until 1971 that marvin gaye was finally able to speak out against the injustices that he saw in the world but when gay finally did speak out it changed music forever on may 21 1971 50 years ago today marvin gaye released a pure protest album that captured the sentiment of the day and an album with lessons we can still learn from 50 years onwards that album was called what&amp;#39;s going on the genesis for what&amp;#39;s going on as an album came from its titular lead single that song was originally written by obi benson of the four tops he wrote it after witnessing police dressed in riot gear who were obscuring badges and assaulting students in berkeley california benson told ben edmonds about his reaction to this scene i saw this and started wondering what the [ __ ] was going on what is happening here one question led to another why are they sending kids so far from their families overseas why are they attacking their own children in the streets here benson took that question and turned it into a song but the four tops refused to record it thanks to motown&amp;#39;s policy on politics but benson knew he had something so when his band members turned down his song he brought it to marvin gaye the lyrics were perfect for an artist who was looking to say something about the world [Music] they were filled with a pacifist tilt talking about the vietnam war but hinted at everything else going on as well don&amp;#39;t punish me with brutality [Music] and even though gordy insisted that motown should be apolitical gay went about and recorded the song anyways that recording session was filled with spontaneous creativity the eli fontaine sac solo that opened the song was just fontaine improvising and loosening up before recording it was serendipity that gave the song its iconic vocals too with several vocal takes layered over one another this came about because gay wanted to listen to two different vocal takes to hear which was better engineer ken sands put one on each side of the stereo mix so they could be compared in real time but gay loved the sound of them together and so he decided to keep it adding multiple vocal layers throughout the choruses of the song the energy and freedom comes through in the sessions with chatter between gay&amp;#39;s friends making it into the mix as well altogether the song is vibrant and lush you can hear gay coming to life as he&amp;#39;s finally able to get his catharsis speaking out against the evils in the world but when gay brought the recording to gordy he was shot down in frankie gay&amp;#39;s memoir he recalls a phone call with his brother where marvin vented about barry gordy barry hates my music he doesn&amp;#39;t want to record it because he doesn&amp;#39;t think it will sell he may be right about that but i don&amp;#39;t care i just want to be heard and that&amp;#39;s all that matters but even as gordy was shutting down the song other powers at the label worked in secret to get it released and in january 1971 to the surprise of both gay and barry gordy what&amp;#39;s going on hit record stores it immediately proved gordy wrong not only did what&amp;#39;s going on sell it became the fastest selling single motown had ever seen moving more than 70 000 copies in its first week and that&amp;#39;s because what&amp;#39;s going on struck a vein with people all across america who were asking themselves that exact same question with the success of the single the tables turned barry gordy came to marvin gaye and asked him for an album to follow it up with the ball entirely in his court gay bargained for complete creative control barry&amp;#39;s only stipulation was that the album needed to be completed by the end of march so with carte blanche marvin gaye went about making the protest album that he had dreamed of making the recording sessions for what&amp;#39;s going on were unorthodox gay and his team would work 12-hour days bring friends into the studio and go through prodigious amounts of scotch and gay looked beyond motown&amp;#39;s typical roster of musicians and songwriters mercy me featured a sack solo from the early rock saxophonist wild bill moore and motown&amp;#39;s elevator operator james nix helped contribute lyrics to three songs on the album it was a far cry from the assembly line process that had defined motown up until that point the result is music that&amp;#39;s loose and groovy with a warm sound that would define r b in the early 70s lyrically the album is a broad protest album that talks about all of the issues that gay saw in his day when he first pitched the album to gordy marvin gaye described it as protesting vietnam police brutality social conditions a lot of stuff and song by song gay addresses all of these the second track on the album is what&amp;#39;s happening brother written from the perspective of a vietnam veteran who comes home to find his country in tatters the character finds that the country he left has changed and that he no longer has a place in it he can&amp;#39;t get a job and the culture has moved at such a pace that he can&amp;#39;t keep up these experiences were inspired by the true story of marvin gaye&amp;#39;s brother frankie who fought in vietnam for three years but it wasn&amp;#39;t just frankie gay&amp;#39;s experience countless young men throughout the 1960s were drafted into an imperialistic war went through hellish trauma and returned to a country that fundamentally did not care for them especially if they were black while the protests against the vietnam war were very much rooted in their time much of the rest of the album is just as relevant today we live in an age of police brutality ecological disaster and systemic apathy where millions are left behind by the governments meant to protect and aid them the third song on what&amp;#39;s going on is flying high in the friendly sky a raw portrait of gay&amp;#39;s own struggles with addiction [Music] 50 years later addiction remains an epidemic in much of north america today throughout the 2010s the prescription opioid crisis ravaged communities that were already impoverished by the 2008 financial crisis it&amp;#39;s these kinds of systemic issues that can make us feel despondent about the world a feeling that gay captures in the next song save the children i just want to ask a question who really cares save a world in despair what&amp;#39;s going on even features a song of environmental protest mercy mercy me the ecology in this song in particular gay was ahead of his time predicting the environmental concerns that loom over generations of youth today but the most relevant song of all might be the last song of the album inner city blues make me want to holler [Music] inner city blues is about the economic disenfranchisement of the lower classes people forced to work long hours for low pay and denied access to basic human rights like housing and healthcare the apollo program of the 1960s and the moon landing were great triumphs for humanity but they rang hollow to a generation of black americans struggling to put food on the table 50 years later tech billionaires are shooting for mars while people starve in the streets and cities burn from climate change choosing to dream of sci-fi futures in space rather than address the real tangible problems here on earth gay discusses one of the biggest of those problems in the fourth verse [Music] the over-policing of poor communities has a long history in the united states it was one of the defining struggles that marvin gaye faced and has only increased with the growth of america&amp;#39;s prison industrial complex 50 years onwards these words probably resonate more than any others on the album as we sit in the midst of a historic movement against police brutality when faced with all the same problems marvin gaye looked back to his early career and looked to the force that had driven him to stardom love but gay didn&amp;#39;t mean a simple romantic love for him love meant a love of his god a love of the planet he lived on and most of all a true grand love for all of humankind in right on gay sings about the power that love can have to bring people [Music] together [Music] but what does love for your fellow man really mean in the modern world i don&amp;#39;t think it simply means being nice to people respecting people i think that love for your fellow man means something greater it means understanding that there are certain rights that everybody is entitled to it means knowing that people deserve clean water healthy food in their bellies roofs above their head and fair pay for fair work and it means being willing to push for these changes on a systemic level even if that means your life might personally change in marvin gaye&amp;#39;s case it meant pushing against a label that told him not to get political love meant using his platform to raise awareness and to fight for causes he believed in what&amp;#39;s going on was a massive risk for marvin gaye but it paid dividends not only did the album sell but it also changed perspectives of what soul music could be suddenly people started to look to motown for the kind of culture shifting records that rock and roll had produced over the last decade in the wake of marvin gaye more motown and soul artists like stevie wonder began to use their platform to speak out creating ambitious works of auteurship in the example that gay set and even today the influence of the album can still be felt marvin gaye&amp;#39;s ethos lives on through the current generation of conscious hip-hop artists like kendrick lamar vince staples and killer mike and in 2020 when rolling stone updated their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time they placed what&amp;#39;s going on at the very top what&amp;#39;s going on didn&amp;#39;t solve the issues of its day but it helped bring awareness to them and helped set a new standard for how musicians can fight them and today 50 years onwards i think that what&amp;#39;s going on merits re-listening and reflection the dreams of marvin gaye may feel far off but with a new generation of youth standing up and fighting for what they believe in perhaps we will finally be able to find the love that marvin gaye was looking for half a century ago with what&amp;#39;s going on marvin gaye proved the power that art has as a tool to push

    "transcript": "hey everybody welcome to the channel michael noland here with the big one finally my review and my comments on led zeppelin&amp;#39;s masterpiece by any sense of that word physical graffiti all right so now physical graffiti of course was the album that led zeppelin released after houses of the holy and before presence now it&amp;#39;s a double album and at 83 minutes it&amp;#39;s what i consider a full double album there are 15 songs eight new ones the rest are songs written and even recorded prior to the recording of this album proper but these weren&amp;#39;t just mere outtakes these were songs that were nearly on led zeppelin albums but were wisely i feel taken off of those albums but fit so wonderfully on this magnificent piece of artwork now initially recordings for this album were to start in 1973 i think it was around november but it was at this time that john paul jones was totally burnt out there was even talk of him leaving the group peter grant a great manager by the way suggested that he take some time off they were all set to record a headley grange the wonderful headley grange and this time instead of the rolling stones mobile studio they had access to ronnie lane&amp;#39;s mobile studio and okay so now when everything&amp;#39;s all set up to get the ball rolling as i told you john paul jones needed a bit of time off so they delayed the beginning of the recording process and this actually allows for a brand new act signed to swan song records bad company and they recorded their magnificent masterpiece their very first album bad company of course and that&amp;#39;s a video that is going to be coming out folks because it&amp;#39;s tied into this story and it&amp;#39;s just such a terrific story in itself and a wonderful magnificent classic piece of artwork in rock and roll so the band has to convene early in 1974 and that&amp;#39;s where the whole process really begins now along with past tracks that they are choosing purposely to revive for this project they also have a basic recording and a working of what would become cashmere this piece of course was put together by john bonham and jimmy page you know the best drummer in rock and roll right okay so now with all of this kind of coming into the mix you can almost see led zeppelin&amp;#39;s mind working here this was going to be an album you see as far as i&amp;#39;m concerned led zeppelin kind of arrived to their later period with houses of the holy and of course i&amp;#39;ve already expressed how i feel that led zeppelin 3 and 4 were led zeppelin in their mid period with led zeppelin 1 and 2 being their early period but instead of an album that they could have produced just with the eight new tracks right that would have established that they had not only leveled up as they had with their previous album houses of the holy but they had learned to even gloss that sound a bit further but not led zeppelin not this collective group of minds they&amp;#39;re seeing something much like what the beatles were seeing for their magnificent double album the beatles aka the white album here they purposefully spin an album that represents them from their mid-period right up into the very absolute grandeur of the track my second favorite led zeppelin track of all time cashmere and if you&amp;#39;ve seen any of my videos you of course know that it loses by a narrow margin to the battle of evermore in my mind all right so first up custard pie lyrically this song is a song we&amp;#39;ve heard many times through the blues format right i&amp;#39;m a backdoor man baby i have no scruples you&amp;#39;re mine but the bluesy tale is still intriguing isn&amp;#39;t it with robert plant supplying some of his finest harp work we almost get that early led zeppelin sound right and yet not quite because john paul jones is on a clavinet and jimmy page is playing his guitar riffs through an arp synthesizer a blend of the old the middle the new definitely the perfect cut to start this magnificent album and one of my favorite led zeppelin cuts next up the rover now jimmy had written this song years before and he had written it primarily as an acoustic piece but they had reworked it electronically and it was set for houses of the holy and so basically all they had to do is have jimmy page re-record some guitar parts for this song and it was complete complete with some very interesting lyrics by robert plant again alluding to the various elements and colors and we&amp;#39;ll get into that in another video as well and all too soon side one ends with the magnificent in my time of dying now this total arrangement to this song was actually led by john bonham one of led zeppelin&amp;#39;s most magnificent ultra pieces at 11 plus minutes this is the perfect song to end side one it leaves you in anticipation of what is yet to come on this already great album and of course it ends with a bit of studio chatter we hear as the song breaks down in the end and i&amp;#39;m of course a big fan of that as i&amp;#39;ve explained in past videos many times side one great groove wonderful tunes i&amp;#39;m ready for side two next up houses of the holy kicks off side two and with this recording they did no further over dubbing this was to be on their album houses of the holy right but led zeppelin felt it sounded inferior to their ears to the similar dancing days i guess if i use my imagination i can hear similarities but to tell you the truth if houses of the holy had this track on it with everything else it had and they had the room to put it on it would rank so much higher in my favorite led zeppelin albums than it already does alright so second song side two trembled underfoot developed from a jam session are you kidding me and when you realize that as they&amp;#39;re developing this it&amp;#39;s bonzo to the rescue actually stepping up to the mighty jimmy page suggesting why don&amp;#39;t you riff instead of these dumb cords you&amp;#39;re playing and jimmy page humble enough to take it and they developed this wonderful track one of my very favorite led zeppelin tracks next up my second favorite led zeppelin song of all time the magnificent cashmere a song that was primarily started by both bonzo and jimmy page at hedley grange and they brought these tapes along for further development and brother further development happened first of all john paul jones comes in with the melotron not only that but he writes and arranges for the strings that would accompany this magnificent masterpiece of a song something this magnificent needed truly superior lyrics and lyrics inspired perhaps from somewhere else than robert plant had fully investigated before well he got the inspiration while on vacation in morocco and these lyrics match this song this is almost hey jude magnificent a pop song as far as i&amp;#39;m concerned and a totally badass rocker all right that covers what would have been a magnificent lp right oh but we&amp;#39;ve got two more sides to talk about and so side three is up and so is the magnificent song in the light now if you just fast forward past that intro chant you would have gotten a almost just regular cut from led zeppelin here it&amp;#39;s not that that part of the song is lacking and they did record that as a track unto itself but they wisely heard that and they knew it was only a portion of a song not yet written and so they slipped this chant in at the beginning and with this chant and what comes later ah this is the very flavor of physical graffiti as a magnificent album alright so next up what led zeppelin album would be complete without a little doodle piece from jimmy page and of course that is totally covered in this piece that he recorded as early as 1970. don&amp;#39;t tell me they didn&amp;#39;t have a vision right from the start they just played it i think a little safe with their first two albums because they had this recording and of course i&amp;#39;m talking about braun you are and i know i&amp;#39;m mispronouncing that but it&amp;#39;s the cowboy in me folks i can&amp;#39;t beat it out of me to save my life now as i&amp;#39;ve said before houses of the holy from the time it came out what was that 73 until probably 20 years as i said i love that album it was my favorite led zeppelin album for decades and it was about two decades there but somewhere in the mid 90s i gave a re-listen to this album always one of my favorite but not my ultimate favorite right but i was either in the right head space to listen to that album that day i placed physical graffiti on my remaining turntable and played all four sides and for the first time i actually liked this next track you know when the album first came out down by the seaside i thought it was a joke song and i didn&amp;#39;t take it very seriously but for whatever reason that day i heard this so i did some research on this song and i found out no it was actually a homage a serious homage to what they heard from neil young especially during his harvest period now as i&amp;#39;ve said in past videos while i lived in north carolina for my junior year in high school i discovered harvest and i consider it one of the greatest albums in rock it would be less than six months later that i purchased houses of the holy and to my ears at that time those were two completely different approaches of music but in this song we can see there have always been similarities even to the more traditional american country approach of neil young next up the closer for side three ten years gone a song with lyrics that robert plant wrote about very personal issues regarding past love affairs wonderful lyrics really and one of the very best tracks on this entire album and very wisely placed here this is a song that has hints of the entire album to it and almost invites the listener to continue the journey on to side four of this wonderful album alright so track one fourth side of physical graffiti night flight a song that was originally recorded and written for led zeppelin iv but you know very wisely left off of that album even if you&amp;#39;ve got that full album and this cut this song doesn&amp;#39;t quite fit but does that make this a weak track no not at all this is a wonderful song one of the best tracks on the album it fits perfectly here and guess what it has room to breathe on this album everything else on four was more focused in another direction they were wise to leave it off that album and they were smart enough to bring it on to this wonderful project next up one of my favorite tracks on the album the wanton song and it is necessary for this song to be on this album this is almost the crunch part two to me and i love it when led zeppelin gets ziggy&amp;#39;s aggie like this i just love this whole approach and anytime they do this it&amp;#39;s almost like with the beatles when paul would occasionally write a song that sounded like it was written from the 30s you know when i&amp;#39;m 64 you know songs like that with led zeppelin going in this direction this is their little oddity section to their total sound and i love this if this song was not on this album i don&amp;#39;t know if i would rate this album as high as i do all right so the next track now don&amp;#39;t get me wrong with this but if there is a weaker cut on this album i would have to say it is boogie was stew now when you realize this is just a jam session you know as jam sessions go this is not a bad track all right this is a good track and there&amp;#39;s a part of me that always loved jam session albums even i love the feel of a good jam but with led zeppelin often being much more structured i&amp;#39;ve always felt that this song felt uneasy but again back to the mid 90s and i heard it for the first time and it fits so wonderfully in this album is it the strongest track no not by far but it adds flavor to this album and i&amp;#39;ll explain that a bit more with the very next track we&amp;#39;re going to discuss you see it&amp;#39;s with black country woman that led zeppelin they don&amp;#39;t jam but they live record in the garden at stargroves and just as the recording begins the band&amp;#39;s got it all worked out and we hear the performance but there&amp;#39;s an airplane that you can hear overhead right initially led zeppelin was not going to release this track they felt it spoiled the recording until they started thinking no this just adds atmosphere this adds a realism an almost special effect to the entire song now with this song played live outdoors and the previous song being a jam session here side four creates an identity unto itself and becomes a must listen this is why the entire album must be listened from beginning to end in order as far as i&amp;#39;m concerned the final track the perfect track to end this album sick again written primarily about groupies they had met along the way and recorded pretty much as a straightforward led zeppelin track but what a track the track is led by of course what we&amp;#39;ve become so familiar with the interplay between jimmy page and bonzo guitar drums drums guitar the give the take the take the give it&amp;#39;s wonderful and it&amp;#39;s so evident on this song which absolutely ends this album on a complete up note for me now this album would continue to be my favorite led zeppelin album for the next 10 years only after a complete re-evaluation somewhere in the mid to late 2000s did i even rank this album as any lower than number one now if you&amp;#39;ve seen my video on my rankings of the led zeppelin albums you know that i currently rank this album at number three but i also explain in that video when you&amp;#39;re dealing with led zeppelin you&amp;#39;re dealing with masterpieces often the difference between these albums is just merely a gauze of a curtain and it is so hard to place them in any type of ranking this magnificent album i feel compares very favorably with the beatles magnificent album titled the beatles but known to us all as the fabulous white album this is led zeppelin&amp;#39;s white album bar none and in my opinion holds quite favorably and these are my two favorite double albums in rock and roll bar none you know when i listen to this album i actually picture led zeppelin playing like in a meadow somewhere it even on cashmere i feel that now that&amp;#39;s how it affected me that day and it&amp;#39;s always been a picture i have even when i play it to this day what are your favorite tracks on this album do you even consider this one of led zeppelin&amp;#39;s good albums is it their best album do you disagree with me it should be ranked higher not only what are your favorite cuts but what are your favorite moments on the album okay so that wraps up the video for today folks this has been one tough one to put together when you have to listen to a double album worth of material over days just so that you can get your thoughts around it it can be quite daunting but it&amp;#39;s been worth it what a trip it&amp;#39;s been for me it&amp;#39;s been a pleasure to put this together for you and let me know if you agree with what i have said about this album thank you so much for all of your input if you see any names in front of me as usual this is my way of saying thank you to any new subscribers to the channel it&amp;#39;s a shout out to them for joining the tribe a thing that&amp;#39;s not very difficult by the way all you have to do is just hit that subscribe to the tribe button and hit that top bell notification and you&amp;#39;ll be notified of all of my future videos all right so that wraps up the video for tonight this is the bottom line i&amp;#39;m michael nolan and i&amp;#39;ll see you in the next video [Music]"

    "transcript": "my sons my daughters how are you I hope you&amp;#39;re well I hope you&amp;#39;re well Anthony fantano here internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for yet another review of an older album for Classics week Miles Davis [ __ ] Brew Miles Davis trumpeteer band leader composer and one of the most versatile musicians in jazz really since Miles Davis started putting out solo albums it seemed that no matter what new idea or musical concept was coming up in jazz he was there to either spearhead it or just wholeheartedly embrace it with a topnotch album that rang true of Bop of cool also his modal Masterpiece kind of blue and later in the late &amp;#39; 60s and early&amp;#39; 70s when avanguard Jazz and fusions of jazz and rock music seemed to be the next new hot thing he was there innovating and while this LP is maybe not my favorite of his Fusion pieces and and definitely not the easiest to listen to there are moments where it does get pretty damn impenetrable I in a way sort of prefer in a silent way for for a shorter easier listen the grooves are a bit clearer the ambient esque interludes on this album are gorgeous and it all seems to be a little bit more composed later after [ __ ] Brew miles would fly in the face of funk and an afro beat with albums like on the corner and the extremely fiery and kind of psychedelic aarta but [ __ ] bruise undying popularity does kind of make it miles definitive Fusion piece and it&amp;#39;s really know wonder why I definitely think the Strong Rock influence on this LP does make it sort of an easy transition for rock music fans this album also for its time had a very ear-catching name as well as an illustrious album cover plus the extremely lengthy list of guest musicians and a very long runtime does make this album pretty much mil&amp;#39;s most ambitious foray into this style of music every track on this LP is a panoramic display of these very loose fluid jams that are very instrument and improv heavy this album is actually pretty post- production intensive for a jazz LP there are a lot of insong edits as well as Echoes reverbs tape delays the sounds on this LP are so clear and sharp and Vivid throw this on some headphones and it&amp;#39;s actually like sitting there in the middle of the studio session there are instruments all over the place there are at least two drummers on every single track typically one mix all the way in the Left Channel and another mixed all the way in the right and the same goes for electric piano players too the track X Pharaoh&amp;#39;s dance in Spanish key feature three electric piano players each now as far as some of my favorite and most notable players on this LP for one there is John mlin guitar player and Billy [ __ ] both who made fantastic music in the infamous Maha Vishnu Orchestra Jack D Janette also brings drums chick Korea plays some fantastic electric piano all over this thing Wayne shorter soprano saxs Joe zenel electric piano and each of them contribute some writing to this LP as well and there are many many other players outside of these guys on this LP2 just a lot of great jazz fusion Giants on this album that either had their own solo albums or projects out there a lot of them on the very jazz fusion friendly label ECM records and another thing that kind of steps this album outside of the traditional Jazz realm for the most part it is electric and just rock instrumentation on this thing the only obvious exceptions being Miles Davis and Wayne shorter but of course Benny Alpin is on a ton of tracks here playing his very prevalent bass clarinet it does feel kind of weird having a woodwind in the midst of all of these guitars and and drum sets on this LP but it actually adds a pretty interesting texture on a lot of these songs I mean with the production the players the instrumentation and the song lengths [ __ ] Brew can pretty much be summed up in one single word and that is excess and I wouldn&amp;#39;t even say it&amp;#39;s like well-groomed excess on a lot of songs here miles is completely happy to sort of lay a Tempo or a groove or a mood or a key out there and just kind of let the jam progress naturally beyond that quietly urging certain band members to improvise at certain times there is definitely not a tight snazzy swinging feel to this LP which usually gets associated with the word Jazz it just goes to show how much of a jazz purist Miles Davis was not if anything he was in fact just an improvisation purist and while [ __ ] Brew was not exactly pushing the Avant guard jazz or The Improv Envelope as hard as some other LPS that came out around this time did or even some LPS that preceded this album [ __ ] Brew is certainly one of the best full lengths when it comes to improv of this shade something that is performed with a large band very lengthy and rock influenced there are parts of these tracks that do feel very clearly composed whether they be introductions or themes or just sort of syncopated riffs something like that that brings the song from one area to another for example the very kind of refined and and slow buildup of instrumentation on this album&amp;#39;s title track as well as miles bright and echoed shots of trumpet once this passes some base guitar and bass clarinet comes through starts playing some lines and the song goes into its next phase a very dark Moody and funky Groove but it&amp;#39;s not like a good time funky Groove I mean it&amp;#39;s just got this very sour quality to it it has this heavy sense of uncertainty everybody&amp;#39;s trying to make note of what everyone else is doing but also be heard and and add something worthwhile it&amp;#39;s this tension that kind of makes the songs on this LP sound a certain way this song and many others on here just bring the just awesome electricity of improvisational chance it&amp;#39;s like what&amp;#39;s going to happen next wow they are really riding this groove so hard it&amp;#39;s getting more tense it&amp;#39;s getting less tense you don&amp;#39;t really get these very clear posts moving any of these tracks from point A to point B to point C when the songs on here shift it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very kind of subtle or gradual shift the music doesn&amp;#39;t just kind of break into a catchy melody or anything like that it doesn&amp;#39;t bring the tension into a sweet spot so that you can kind of have a break and not think of what&amp;#39;s going on and if the NeverEnding sense of tension for 20 sometimes almost 30 minutes makes you uncomfortable and totally turns you off to the idea of listening to a record then that&amp;#39;s fine maybe the selfie isn&amp;#39;t for you but regardless of how planned out this album is or isn&amp;#39;t I will say that you&amp;#39;re basically hearing on this album track for track some fantastic performances from some of the best players in this style around this time now as far as other notable moments outside of the jams easily the introduction to to the song Pharaoh&amp;#39;s dance that Baseline right at the beginning is unmistakable and the droplets of electric piano slowly falling onto that track are just gorgeous it&amp;#39;s such again a very Vivid cinematic song If the first two tracks the longest two tracks on this LP are maybe a little too dismal a little too long- winded for you or uneventful then definitely try out the song Spanish key really one of the more hard grooving tracks on this album and on this track you really do feel the those double drum sets as the band is hitting some really fast tempos as they boil over with energy plus there&amp;#39;s a spot in the song where John mlin and and chick Korea are dueling in each Channel guitar and electric piano it&amp;#39;s fantastic hearing them Just Bounce leads and Melodies off of one another after that Wayne shorter has a huge solo piece in the middle of this song and his playing is fantastic especially when he hits those high notes and lets them ring out and the way he moves and sh shifts in intensity as the band gets louder or gets softer Underneath Him is just really impressive around 8:45 on the song This riff sort of Pops in that changes the song into another gear or just sort of a a revamped Groove that&amp;#39;s not the only time this occurs in that track but it&amp;#39;s really one of the most clear sort of shifts from One Moment In a song to another on this entire LP like I said there are changes and there are posts on this album it&amp;#39;s just that they&amp;#39;re usually pretty subtle and sort of slow arriving really the meat and potatoes and what makes this album so attractive are the jams John mlin kills it on the track that he&amp;#39;s attached to Miles Davis runs the voodoo down is another hard groving song if you&amp;#39;ve loved Spanish key and what was once The Closer on here Sanctuary before a lot of modern reissues of this LP added another song toward the end of this album which is also awesome but still back to Sanctuary I love the skittering drums on that track and the way the slow moving and echoed horns kind of interact with the drum sets on the track it&amp;#39;s just so so strange there&amp;#39;s not much more that I could say about this LP in terms of describing the tracks I mean to go beyond where I am now I feel like would be insane I would be describing literal solo moments in the middle of the songs and the thing is if if how I&amp;#39;ve described this album generally sounds completely like a turnoff to you then chances are you don&amp;#39;t care what the solo sound like if you&amp;#39;re looking to get into jazz music there are more access ible and more traditional albums that you could listen to a lot of them made by Miles Davis but if you want to listen to some really strong unique improvisational music with some potent moods some very clear Vivid instrumentation just piled in layers upon layers upon layers that you can really get lost in for hours and hours at a time then give this a try Miles Davis [ __ ] Brew if you&amp;#39;ve given this a listen what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why is this one of your favorite albums of all time if so why why not let me know Anthony fantano [ __ ] Brew [Music] forever"

    "transcript": "up hey everyone Anthony fantano here internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a classic review classic classic classic review of Talking Heads remain in light 1980 album legendary new wave and postp punk outfit Talking Heads David burn Tina way mouth Chris France Terry Harrison formed in 1975 and they were one of many great bands to play at the legendary New York music club cbgbs which was formerly the stomping grounds of many greats television Richard hell the Ramones Patty Smith Sonic Youth the list is endless the place was literally a petri dish for some of the most essential alternative music ever recorded now in their early years Talking Heads sound was a bit of a crossover kind of a bridge between two worlds the band while their music was alternative and had the eccentricities and and the risk-taking qualities of punk music they were very in touch with contemporary pop and dance music as well borrowing grooves from the worlds of disco and funk and applying them to some really strange ideas eccentric vocals and lyrics from David burn really Herky and jerky bass and guitars Give a listen to the iconic single Psycho Killer if you&amp;#39;re kind of looking for an example over time the band&amp;#39;s music would only get more ambitious bigger instrumentation awesome ballads like the song Heaven an eyebrow raising cover of Take Me to the River incorporating elements of African music especially into the Rhythm Section of their music the band&amp;#39;s rhythms became smoother more dancable in a way more accessible but still simultaneously David Burn&amp;#39;s vocal performances would also become Wilder and this would all come to aead on the band&amp;#39;s 1980 record remain in light their most popular studio album which also contained their most significant hit song Once in a Lifetime and with Brian Eno on production of Roxy Music Fame he&amp;#39;s also had some great solo records ambient works this album would not be assembled in the same way that previous Talking Heads records were the songs on this album are essentially a series of licks and Snippets and Loops recorded from the band itself and then assembled into these longer compositions and the instrumentals are masterfully assembled as the grooves on this thing really hold water we&amp;#39;re talking about a lot of instrumental layers on this thing considering that that many of them are samples that many of them are just chunks of sounds guitars bass vocals and background vocals horns poly rhythms and hand percussions synths and various sound effects and weird glitchy edits none of this Probably sounds all that radical in an age of LCD sound system but when you consider this album came out in 1980 in a musical landscape of Michael Jackson Olivia Newton John sticks Air Supply hardcore punk Blondie Queen Billy Joel and straightforward synth pop this thing&amp;#39;s pretty Progressive the grooves on this thing as I said they&amp;#39;re Flawless they&amp;#39;re hypnotic they&amp;#39;re fluid throughout the entire record and the album essentially Works in two halves it kicks off with a really explosive visceral start and then eventually into something way more abstract and Spacey around houses in motion the song Born Under punches starts the entire record it&amp;#39;s a song that is as funky as it is unsettling the track features these popped pronounced baselines very jerky guitars it&amp;#39;s clunky it&amp;#39;s cluttered but it&amp;#39;s got a beat to it a really good beat too uh I also like the little diddling Eerie strange guitars that sort of find themselves looping back into the track again and again and again and David Burn&amp;#39;s lyrics Here seem like uh he&amp;#39;s talking about government oppression and pressure to sort of lead a certain life or give into what the system wants you to do which is not a new lyrical theme for him but it seems like he&amp;#39;s approaching it in a more abstract way with these really pronounced Pro proclamations I&amp;#39;m a tumbler and then chilling the goes out with these very stone-faced refrains as he&amp;#39;s singing All I want is to breathe there&amp;#39;s also a freaky Twisted guitar solo on this thing that sounds like it was mangled in a tape machine or something I love the studio trickery that goes into this record there&amp;#39;s so much detail in the these linear hypnotic songs and there&amp;#39;s also a really cool refrain in the second half that I like a lot I sort of wonder if lyrically it&amp;#39;s kind of a play on the idea uh that the beat goes on but David burn and Company are singing instead the heat goes on and the heat goes on and the heat goes on the song&amp;#39;s cross-eyed and painless and the great curve really turn the heat up intensify the record they deliver some of the tightest speediest beats the dense layers of instrumentation on this thing are awesome the vocals the guitars the poly rhythms the bass the keys and lyrically once again David burn sort of goes neurotic much in the way that he was on Psycho Killer and many other tracks too as he obsesses over lines and shapes and facts underneath David Burn&amp;#39;s emotional chaos each instrument is sort of just like a little tiny sliver of sound and Melody sort of just a very small embellishment that all together creates this larger tapestry I just love the layers on this record I love how the Assembly of these sounds comes together especially as the band Works in these refrains these vocal refrains that are all thrown on top of each other it&amp;#39;s not odd to hear three different refrains being being sung over one another at different speeds and paces the great curve is an example of that and lyrically this song is I think uh going into this idea of being anxious over not completely understanding the world and this is set against imagery of a woman dancing and this woman is being controlled maybe remote controlled it seems like those themes of government control or system control are coming back that were introduced at the int track and with the song once in a lifetime we have a career defining group Grove on this thing I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s so good boom boom boom and this Baseline is just plunged into a sea of just swirling sparkling shimmering arpeggios and the band maintains the beat as they switch from this chorus that is super sweet Soulful inspiring almost Heavenly and then these very pronounced animated spoken word vocals uh the comparison has been made before that David burn sounds a lot like a preacher on this track and I have to agree it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s almost as if he&amp;#39;s you know telling the crowd something preaching something but but that only kind of comes through in the tone of his voice I feel like lyrically this song is a little too abstract and it&amp;#39;s really just supposed to confuse and emotionally stir the listener and kind of reflect on the speed of life and how water for example is brought up as a theme in this track is kind of like the current pushing you onto the next stage of life and you can&amp;#39;t really control it the album goes dark and introspective on houses in motion David Burn&amp;#39;s vocals turn very soft very quiet spoken word and then he&amp;#39;s switching that off with his trademark eccentric yelpy vocal delivery on the chorus but what really steals the show for me is the really gummy Baseline the awesome guitar licks on this track and what sounds like horns just popping up so sporadically in the mix that they&amp;#39;re unpredictable almost like glitchy just really interesting sound for this record and for anybody really and the record gets even more cerebral on the song seen and not seen the instrumental is enveloping it&amp;#39;s watery it&amp;#39;s psychedelic it&amp;#39;s vast and the lyrics sound like they&amp;#39;re dealing in vanity with a man who is thinking about his facial structure and how he prefers these particular facial structures that he sees on celebrities on magazines and so on and so forth so he&amp;#39;s thinking that if he imagines the facial structure that he wants to have in the Forefront or in the you know back burner of his mind that he&amp;#39;ll eventually have that face it&amp;#39;s uh strange to say the least but that&amp;#39;s uh you know sort of the odd feelings that a talking head record could bring up and then there&amp;#39;s listening wind and it&amp;#39;s kind of interesting to see the trajectory of this record I love the flow of this album comparing this track to the first track here we&amp;#39;ve gone from something that is really complex Progressive noisy clunky dense to something much more sparse and primordial this song here in comparison with the earlier portion of the record is like a dream state the track is relaxing it kind of puts me into a lull but it&amp;#39;s haunting too and what&amp;#39;s even more haunting is the closer here the overload which is super dreary and dystopian the vibe of the song is is almost Gothic in a way which makes the track stand out like a sore thumb uh and I guess it&amp;#39;s just another moment where uh the album&amp;#39;s flow has to be sort of admired because it started off with so much fire and now as it&amp;#39;s finishing it&amp;#39;s in an incredibly dark place it&amp;#39;s uh not exactly leaving you on a happy ending here but still I love this album it&amp;#39;s a great record it&amp;#39;s a progressive record uh uh it&amp;#39;s a a Forward Thinking album but yet uh and and maybe this is only because you know it&amp;#39;s we have hindsight when we&amp;#39;re listening to this record um it&amp;#39;s still so catchy you know it&amp;#39;s still so easy to listen to It&amp;#39;s still so visceral still so dancable and even the tracks that don&amp;#39;t really rely that heavily on a Groove in the latter half are engaging at least on a you know a mental level this thing is just a bold eccentric out there statement and I will probably continue to love it and admire it for that for years to come and I can only hope that you&amp;#39;re doing that with me with this review I think we&amp;#39;re going to leave it at that classic transition have you given this album a listen I I would hope so classic review man I would hope so and uh if you have did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you the best you the best what should I review next have a good day that&amp;#39;s what I say arms are looking sh sorry sorry guys sorry don&amp;#39;t mean to don&amp;#39;t mean to flex on you forever"

Age hip hop starter pack uh keep in mind just like our death metal video which we will link you to at the end of this video we&amp;#39;re actually probably going to do a nice little playlist of this series getting getting winded here I&amp;#39;m so excited it&amp;#39;s actually more like hyperventilating [Laughter] all right sorry I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m done being cringey I apologize uh listen this is not a list of the best hip-hop records of the 80s or anything like that this is just a list of albums to get you started to try out this sound try out this style get into it you know I didn&amp;#39;t cover every major artist in this era I&amp;#39;ll tell you right away that um I did not mention and do highly recommend if you listen to all of these that you hear out some uh L Cool J some boogie down Productions krs1 that sort of thing um so I didn&amp;#39;t get to everybody obviously and um this the thing about albums in the earliest days of hip-hop like they don&amp;#39;t paint a full picture because in the early early days some of the biggest hip-hop uh pieces of most significant pieces of hip-hop music were just singles you know Planet Rock um the message Grand Master Flash you know that sort of thing so you know if you want a fuller picture you know you got to go back and listen to those early classic singles that sort of set the stage set the tone you know I would say Sugar Hill Gang if not for the fact that you all have probably heard that song you know a million times over by now uh but you know having said that um so here&amp;#39;s an array of albums that I am recommending to you guys and uh let&amp;#39;s get into it let&amp;#39;s get into it these will all be listed down there in the description box let&amp;#39;s kick it off with Mr Slick Rick The Great Adventures of Slick Rick um obviously in East Coast MC as pretty much everybody in this list will be you know sorry to the West Coast sorry of the South but you know we&amp;#39;re talking New York here we&amp;#39;re talking Golden Age you know let it be um Slick Rick Immaculate fantastic Storyteller um songs like children&amp;#39;s story still today rank as some of the best hip-hop songs of all time um has been copied over and over and over you know or at least referenced uh numerous times throughout many A hip-hop album to come after it um you know it&amp;#39;s a genius track and there are many other genius tracks on this thing you know also recommend this album to anybody who says you know oh today hip hop is so vulgar because slick RI was pretty nasty you know at least on a couple tracks on this thing you know but he was lyrical again and primarily um a fantastic storyteller great sense of humor lots of attention to detail obviously sort of a point or a sort of a message in every single track you know whether or not you agree with the message or the me the message is a really all that helpful or wholesome you know I think is uh you know dependent upon the song but Slick Rick fantastic Storyteller solid flow too he&amp;#39;s not one of these you know super old school rappers from the early early early 80s I mean obviously you know he had been at this for a little while before he put this album out but his style had evolved and progressed to the point where his rapping here is much smoother this is not your stereotypical I&amp;#39;m sitting on hat I&amp;#39;m sitting on a cat I&amp;#39;m sitting on a mat I&amp;#39;m sitting on a bat you know that sort of thing you know just the one single syllable Rhymes and you know very basic rhyme structures like you know he had a lot going for him and I think uh part of what sort of pushed him to wrap with the complexity for his time that he did was that he wanted to tell these very detailed stories so that caused him to sort of you know ress his style and push his rapping ability uh to sort of you know again tell these stories that he tells on this record next got to give a shout out to the self-titled Run DMC album uh this came out in the mid 80s uh beats are very rickety on this thing but still run and DMC have an incredible amount of um I guess chemistry you know it&amp;#39;s one of these early hip-hop acts that sort of emphasized um you know this kind of shouty flow that shouty delivery with lots of moments where you know they&amp;#39;re trading bars off and then one member will sort of emphasize the voice or a lyric from another member by repeating the entire lyric or a single word you know sort of emphasize that ba ba ba you know it&amp;#39;s actually really still to this day pretty energizing pretty exciting pretty electrifying um this is one of those 80s hip-hop releases that in my opinion I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not their most smooth and well produced release I mean um just just a few years later I think the production value um increased exponentially but I&amp;#39;m sort of recommending this to give you kind of a picture of how kind of rudimentary and Bare Bones some of this early hip-hop stuff was you know and be and Run DMC isn&amp;#39;t even you know as stripped back as some of it got um you know I&amp;#39;m actually trying to recommend this to show you that despite the fact that it was kind of bare bones there&amp;#39;s still like a hard Groove to a lot of it there&amp;#39;s still a very tight a very energizing funkiness to it and um uh there&amp;#39;s like this incredible electrifying energy to um the vocals the vocal performances on this thing um you know lyrics are really catchy hooks are really catchy a lot of rock music sampled um uh throughout some of the tracks here uh overall good album very fun performances very entertaining record okay Public Enemy while this record came out in the 80s it was very much the late 80s and in a lot of ways was kind of a I I guess the shape of rap to come you know because the uh vocals and the rapping from Chuck D were really aggressive uh the production handled by the bomb squad was was really noisy and chaotic and very detailed and very layered uh there are some elements of the production of this album to this day it&amp;#39;s sort of a mystery as to how they did it because you know that&amp;#39;s just how crazy and off the- wall and sort of Cutting Edge some of the production on this album was uh because again it was so nutty it was so detailed um you know this was like you know an allog together new thing to have beats that sounded like this and beats that sounded like uh what the Dust Brothers did on Paul&amp;#39;s Boutique um the production on this thing again insane um you know but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not just really about the Beats on this thing uh you know Chuck D super politically charged lyrics really thoughtful lyrics incredibly captivating very author ative MC um and Public Enemy you know given their image here given the logo given you know just the name Public Enemy of course you know what they&amp;#39;re rapping about is very um I don&amp;#39;t know I guess kind of anti-stem it&amp;#39;s very edgy it&amp;#39;s very angry it&amp;#39;s very aggressive it&amp;#39;s very revolutionary you know that&amp;#39;s very much the tone of a lot of Public Enemies music and uh this album in my opinion is really kind of the peak of that message the peak of the band&amp;#39;s Talent the peak of their songwriting ability I mean you know if if you want you could go back a few years and listen to Yo bum rush the show you know their debut it&amp;#39;s pretty good you know it&amp;#39;s not as good as this um it in a lot of ways it is much more rudimentary the songwriting is not so much there Chuck D&amp;#39;s flow is not as smooth there as it was here um Flav of flave is not quite as exciting a hyp man there as he is here you know this is really where Public Enemy really came into their own and despite the fact that again it&amp;#39;s kind of a bit of a shape of hip-hop to come kind of thing um you know I do want to sort of display that there there was a lot going on in the 80s you know there was a lot of progression from the early 80s to the late 80s and a lot of people consider the early 90s to sort of be part of the golden age anyway so um it&amp;#39;s not like even sort of throwing in some late 80s releases is necessarily a bad thing but I&amp;#39;m just sort of digressing PA in full Eric B and rock Kim um fantastic album fantastic record um I&amp;#39;m not really sure what else to say beyond that I mean there&amp;#39;s a lot of great songs on here a lot of great hooks I guess what I have to emphasize just like anybody would if bringing up this album is that rockim was truly a Cutting Edge MC and uh you know there&amp;#39;s really there&amp;#39;s really no bones about that um his flow for his time period was incredibly smooth and cool and laidback there wasn&amp;#39;t kind of this clunkiness this awkwardness that at the time maybe wasn&amp;#39;t apparent but in retrospect you know when you listen to rap in the 2000s and the 90s today and then compare it to some of the flows you were getting in the 80s this was the flow everybody who heard it does know you know that sort of thing um rockim was you know really kind of a his own animal you know and and because of that uniqueness of his flow and his style and his delivery he influenced so many people that came after him I mean not even people that came after him he influenced his contemporaries people who were rapping in the same time period that he was were biting him and copying him uh Inc um the word I want to say is um unashamedly because the ideas that he lyrical and um you know rhythmic ideas that he came up with and that he delivered on this record and their following record too um were so great and so Universal and so necessary to copy in order to bring the genre forward so um you know you got to you got to listen to this because you know rockim again super Cutting Edge and if not for his rapping if not for his rap style hip hop would sound completely different today you know not to say that it would just get stuck in the 80s and it would just sound like that forever um but uh you know he influenced a lot of people he influence a lot of people and he progressed the genre in a way that very few other artists did moving on to de Soul&amp;#39;s first project 3T high and Rising um you know de Soul obviously considered a part of the whole native tongues movement and um you know you&amp;#39;re talking about RS that are cool they&amp;#39;re laid-back they&amp;#39;re Jazzy a lot of them are Afrocentric um socially aware and conscience conscious excuse me um deas Soul though sharp sense of humor you know some of the skits on this thing are gut-bustingly funny or silly or ridiculous maybe the uh with so much time passing after this album some of their uh shine has sort of been lost but still I mean the rap tracks are incredibly entertaining very smooth flows um you know very funky uh lots of personality you know deas Soul had an incredible amount of Personality for their time period um really I mean a lot of the time I would say that was kind of the selling point of deasel that you know the lyrics and and really sort of the whole tone of this album and a lot of their projects to follow you know kind of had a weird tongue-and-cheek kind of character to them um you know they were kind of wild they were kind of weird very playful and um uh so I guess that&amp;#39;s you know just kind of a um you know it&amp;#39;s it doesn&amp;#39;t border on Comedy hip-hop or anything like that but uh you know they definitely had a strong sense of humor that came out in their music you know so I guess it&amp;#39;s kind of um you know a good thing to uh display that um you know hip-hop wasn&amp;#39;t just kind of this super gritty super serious thing you know as you may know it today super aggressive super violent super mad super iny face you know these guys you know sort of had a different sort of tone about them and you know in the future when sort of Hardcore hip hop rose up and became more you know aggressive and violent in your face you know they were like kind of poking fun at that a little bit too you know because that was just totally not their vibe that was not their sound that was not their style and um yeah 3et high and Rising highly recommended and finally I will recommend Beasty Boys Paul&amp;#39;s Boutique I mean I don&amp;#39;t know how much I really need to say about this project because I kind of mentioned how fantastic and amazing the production is um when I was talking about Public Enemy earlier I mean most people have heard the Beasty Boys their lyrical and their vocal style has not really changed that much over the years and you could make the argument that um you know with Paul&amp;#39;s Boutique uh it was really kind of at its peak Paul&amp;#39;s Boutique um ill communication you know that sort of whole era in their career and I mean I like licens to Ill but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not their best album in my opinion um and I guess if you want more of a you know purist earlier mid 80s hip-hop sound you would probably want to go listen to that instead you know their debut Licensed to Ill um you know even though there were a lot of things about that album that to a real hip-hop purist might sort of you know turn them off a little bit because there are a lot of rock samples it it was very much a rock album that was kind of marketed to like you know know white high school kids and college kids and that sort of thing so uh you know maybe uh you know but the thing is uh Paul&amp;#39;s Boutique was so good that even beasty boy contemporaries and you know the hip-hop fans that may have dismissed them out of the gate had to kind of take them seriously because this was a really good very good album um you know again even if it is a lot like um you know that Public Enemy album nation of millions uh uh that it was just kind of like more of a shape of rap to come sort of thing because the samples on this thing the beats the production on this thing we&amp;#39;re just so ahead of the curve and um yeah so Beasty Boys Paul&amp;#39;s Boutique uh 3 feet high and rising from de los Soul Eric be and rockim paid in full Public Enemy it takes a nation of millions Run DMC self-titled and Slick Ricks the Great Adventures of this is uh my starter pack for you guys so if you&amp;#39;re looking to get into Golden Age hip-hop 8s hip-hop listen to these albums obviously there are more to try out more to listen to Beyond this but these should get you started you know and if you&amp;#39;re going to you know and once you listen to these albums you know you could start or sort of have an interesting conversation sort of on this style on this sound on this era maybe not a full or complete conversation but you know if you&amp;#39;re talking with somebody and like Rick comes up Run DMC comes up public enemy comes up you&amp;#39;re going to know what&amp;#39;s going on you know um and that&amp;#39;s going to be it guys thanks for watching hopefully you take these recommendations give all these albums a listen and and I will catch you in the next video you&amp;#39;re the best forever oh yeah and here&amp;#39;s the um death metal video next to my head over here check that out too woo [Music]"

    "genre": "Art Pop",
    "transcript": "hi everyone triumphs in a car tan oh here the Internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of a classic album because classic sweet Kate Bush is an English singer-songwriter and producer who has been dropping albums since the late 70s and has seen incredible success across the length of her career from her debut single weathering Heights which was a number-one single in the UK and dropped when Kate was still a teen - her latest full-length album fifty words for snow which was very well received and came out not too long ago kate is one of those artists whose miraculously been able to attain mainstream success while also pleasing very discerning music fans and on top of all of it crafting a distinct sound that has made her one of modern music&amp;#39;s most praised voices her music is highly influential even today thanks to her fantastic songwriting as well as her pioneering in art pop and baroque pop and some of her greatest and most timeless ideas turn up here on her 1985 album hounds of love a record loaded with lofty and dramatic ideas but surprisingly the songs still stay very direct instantaneous visceral catchy much of the material on this record is incredibly pleasing on first listen this isn&amp;#39;t really a record you need to sit with and repeat time and time again in order to good though more lessons do reveal more beautiful details and the lyrics and the instrumentation but this album&amp;#39;s explosive love ability is thanks in part to the first half&amp;#39;s immense singles Big Sky the title track running up that hill as well as cloud busting but the second half of this LP titled something else entirely the ninth wave feels like a different project entirely and what begins this suite of songs is sort of like a musical dream sequence Kate even says in the lyrics she can&amp;#39;t be left alone with her imagination nation nations because it seems like she&amp;#39;s haunted by lingering memories and pretty disturbing nightmares in the following tracks a lot of the songs on this half of the record are kind of stirring occasionally surreal lyrically and sonically some of the experimentation here is quite jarring and in my opinion kind of a precursor to a lot of what would occur on records from Bjork and the knife years down the road K even pulls from Celtic music on the incredibly lush jig of life so not only his hounds of love a strange diverse and beautiful record but it&amp;#39;s also a payoff that came after an initial risk from Kate Kate&amp;#39;s previous LP the dreaming an enjoyable album but not really her most successful commercially was the first time she tried to take on production duties all on her own some of the mixing on this record was a little odd Kate&amp;#39;s vocals were incredibly loud on some songs and instrumentally this set of songs was a little more skeletal than her previous work less extravagant than some of the music on her previous record especially considering on that album landed songs like babushka and the song violin to another Kate Bush song I&amp;#39;m just head over heels for especially due to the progressive rock influence on that track which isn&amp;#39;t too big of a surprise considering that David Gilmour of Pink Floyd was an early and huge supporter of Kate&amp;#39;s music career so taking the experience from the Dreaming and now working with a series of engineers and fantastic session musicians one of which is her brother Kate really comes through with an undeniable hit commercially and artistically and she also makes sure to embrace the blossoming world of synth pop on this record - with some really bold hooks and very prominent keyboards on a lot of the cuts here there is more arranged instrumentation - in comparison with the dreaming this LP is so much more lush take into account all the multi-tracked vocals on the song big sky which makes that track just feel huge hounds of love really helped Kate gain that international audience that she still maintains today even with incredibly minimal touring and live performances because in the case of Kay Bush the music is really all you need running up that hill incredible opener for this record epic galloping rhythm that kicks this song off the kind of a rhythm that wouldn&amp;#39;t be too unfamiliar to someone who was listening to new wave and synth pop a cave really does this rhythm one better with some really thunderous percussion on the hook and I love the way Kate&amp;#39;s voice just juts into the instrumental as if she&amp;#39;s attacking as she&amp;#39;s singing and from what I can hear in this track she seems to be singing about two lovers one of whom the protagonist here really wishes to make a deal with God in order to have the other the significant other sort of understand our protagonists point of view what she is going through just to come to some kind of better understanding which seems like a very simple desire but the way Kate approaches the song lyrically with such poetic words and instrumentally she makes this wish seem so grand and so urgent so huge on the title track of the selfie Kate&amp;#39;s voice just sticks out once again there&amp;#39;s kind of a very sharp reverb as if she recorded her vocals in like a stone hallway or something she&amp;#39;s like a vocal ray of light just shining brightly right in your face in the midst of very urgent string sections Airy sense and a very spacious expressive drumbeat but my favorite single on side a of this LP has to be cloud busting which is hands down one of the best baroque pop songs ever just some simple strings playing the chords of the song a very strict back drumbeat and vocal melody this track doesn&amp;#39;t need much more to make it fantastic because the writing is just that good the vocal melody is so amazing Kate singing is incredibly dramatic but she doesn&amp;#39;t take away from the the catchiness of the song by just overdoing and even while holding back her singing is still a very emotional experience and the lyrics of the song there&amp;#39;s a real sense of anticipation the second half of this record as I said earlier really is its own beast it&amp;#39;s a very abstract and what I interpret to be a kind of personal set of tracks starting with a very dreamy reflective intro and the following track under the ice feels like the initial entrance into the dreamscape later down the line the jig of life has some really boisterous strings I really determined drum be it&amp;#39;s not a single but every bit as thrilling as many of the cuts on the first half I love the acoustic direction the instrumental takes on this track and Kate&amp;#39;s singing on this song is just definition of conviction then there&amp;#39;s the sonically disturbing waking which very few musicians and lusts Mort is one of them create sounds that to me are literally frightening and Kate Bush is one of those artists in this case the loud sound effects and the choppy weird vocals that enter into the track at one point and seem to be kind of a theme on this half of the record which might seem like another memory calling her to another part of this dream state or maybe even real-life trying to pull her out of this dream state entirely I&amp;#39;m not totally sure but it&amp;#39;s you know really a weird disturbing thing other voices and singers actually play a pretty significant role on this half of the record as if K is playing the lead role in some kind of inception like musical journey one of the final tracks on this half of the record hello earth actually seems kind of musical theatre inspired with its huge group chorus and pit orchestra inspired instrumentation that kind of segues the song from one part to another and Kate unlike some other people who also try to go down this direction can give that musical theatre like presentation while also maintaining that intimate passion that you should feel with with a singer/songwriter this track really coasts down fades out and disintegrates very slowly it kind of feels like the very end of the movie on this half of the album and then the closing track the morning fog kind of feels like Kate waking up from all of these dreams with some very sensual soft vocals what sounds like some some slinky fretless bass and some violins 2k seems to be kind of frightened by what happened and talking about telling her loved ones that she loves them the song ends a little abruptly and I think that&amp;#39;s because there&amp;#39;s really not that much more to say it seems kind of like a Wizard of Oz Judy Garland kind of waking up from the fantasy land kind of moment and you were there and you were there and no you weren&amp;#39;t there you weren&amp;#39;t there at all but you were there hounds of love ninth wave really a fantastic set of songs great detail great writing incredibly catchy especially on the first half and then the second half on here a little more long-winded but Kate makes use of the space to create something really beautiful and sometimes disturbing in a few cases and no matter what sight of that she&amp;#39;s exploring you&amp;#39;re always going to be in for something that is loaded with immense emotion I think should give this record listen if you haven&amp;#39;t already but if you have good on you and I hope you enjoy this album as much as me and I love you transition if you&amp;#39;ve given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that&amp;#39;s it Anthony Fantan Oh Kate Bush hounds of love classics week forever"

know more more is all you need that&amp;#39;s it you only need a little bit more to get that same hit that you had last time but then after that it&amp;#39;s like oh now you need just a little bit more to get another hit like that to have that same high as you had last time and this is speaking not from the perspective of someone who is abusing drugs this is speaking from the perspe how i&amp;#39;m killing you this is speaking from the perspective of the drug itself so we&amp;#39;re basically personifying the drugs aren&amp;#39;t we wow that&amp;#39;s deep [Music] who says we can only get deep in rap and have like double layers and [ __ ] like that this is [Music] oh [Music] wow master of pup is pulling the strings because obviously once you become addicted it just affects your whole life the only thing you&amp;#39;re concerned with then is achieving that next high and it just warps everything and really it is the drugs who then pull the strings on your life i love the way that this sets up man i was thinking like master of puppets i didn&amp;#39;t know if we were getting political with it i didn&amp;#39;t know if we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about like politicians or some [ __ ] i wasn&amp;#39;t sure what direction we&amp;#39;re going but wow what a twist on this and then the way that just grungy gritty electric guitar hits man donna just timing with the delivery of that love how that fits in and then there&amp;#39;s just like a breath like a moment like hang on what the hell is next and then we just get hit again and just like slapped in the face with it [Music] is [Music] and even that line like i take deeper just call my name because i&amp;#39;ll hear you scream like you&amp;#39;re screaming out inside like you you want to be free from this but you can&amp;#39;t and you&amp;#39;re so addicted to the mastery [Music] yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very clever now how this is written the way that the words are chosen and the metaphors that are depicted needle work the way right carefully picking like doing needlework something very precise but in this case the needle goes even deeper because like a heroin needle going into the veins that we had in that first verse [Music] that&amp;#39;s what i mean lines like that pain monopoly ritual misery because it&amp;#39;s like a ritual at this point you keep doing it and you keep having this hype then you end up having this extreme low and you just get caught in this never-ending ritual of misery in terms of how you take it how you lined it up if you&amp;#39;re snorting again if you&amp;#39;re shooting it in whatever your poison is that you&amp;#39;re picking again just very i love the way that these words are put together and the phrasing to them it&amp;#39;s it is it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s dark twisted [ __ ] poetry [Music] chop your breakfast on a mirror because then cocaine right chopping up cocaine lines like sitting on the mirror doing it but also cocaine because it makes you so you&amp;#39;re not hungry anymore so literally your breakfast is drugs dedicated [Music] okay [Music] i mean even that that cover art is so dope because you have the hands up at the top pulling the strings in this case the strings connect to the different graves and you have the crosshair and you&amp;#39;ve got the metallica over top of it all love the imagery matching up the theme of the song [Music] roster oh switch up [Music] wow total switch up i mean i&amp;#39;m ready to get the [ __ ] candles out and have a seance right now [Music] more melodic guitar now [Music] nice acoustic electric oh okay [Music] wow [Music] wow that guitar line [Music] [Applause] [Music] it&amp;#39;s like beautiful but it&amp;#39;s haunting at the same time [Applause] [Music] where we going oh [Music] i don&amp;#39;t know why the way this is hitting it makes me think it&amp;#39;s just like a clock going like tick tick tick tick tick tick tick like time is counting down and things are kind of speeding up here in a sense like they slowed down for a second but now it&amp;#39;s speeding up almost like the euphoric high from drugs then the immediate crash and fall from it and our life is burning faster the more we become addicted the closer we march toward our deaths [Music] where&amp;#39;s the dreams that i&amp;#39;ve been after because that first time doing it is like a dream right and then you always want to achieve that first moment of contact you know that that first euphoric feeling that you can never get to it can almost feel like dreams and what you can accomplish you can do anything but really it&amp;#39;s all lies when they tear it down at the [Music] laughing at my cries all i see is laughter at first i thought maybe he&amp;#39;s laughing like maniacally laughing away like a super villain but no someone else is laughing probably the master is laughing at him because he&amp;#39;s crying laughing at my cries and my demise [Music] oh no that goes deeper and i don&amp;#39;t want to ruin this nasty guitar that just kicked in for a second but fix me get it like getting your fix because he wants to be fixed on one sense and he wants to overcome this so he wants to be changed and fixed but then also like getting your fix getting your head getting your hide that that&amp;#39;s clever writing oh come on [Music] what are you doing [Music] oh [Music] man [Music] oh [Music] hell is worth all that a natural habitat it&amp;#39;s like our natural ecosystem we know where we&amp;#39;re heading at this point in time wow i mean that is just twisted as [ __ ] [Music] i will occupy i will help you die again the way that this is written from the first person perspective of actually being the drug like i will take over i will occupy your life and i will lead you and march you literally to your death [Music] it&amp;#39;s definitely a song to play like christmas time when all the families gathered around and getting ready to open presents and hold hands [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Laughter] oh wow happy halloween everyone i mean first that demonic laugh got me off to the side that makes all of a sudden you had like all those different voices it&amp;#39;s almost like i just picture like being like dragged down into the depths of hell and you hear like just the demons around you and the dead spirits as they&amp;#39;re kind of like calling to you like that just twisted demonic laughing and spirit of it all and you talk about obey your master [ __ ] man obey the masters of metal metallica i mean that was just an adrenaline pumping ride and the thing is the lyrics were ma obviously i love the lyrics being a rapper myself and i&amp;#39;m always going to tune into the lyrics and i love the poetry the lyrics i love the the storytelling like we talked about the writing the the very clever word choice and the metaphors that were used but then on top of that like for me the song wasn&amp;#39;t just about the lyrics it was about some of those just nasty guitar riffs and just some of the pacing like you didn&amp;#39;t actually need lyrics for this song and the atmosphere and the energy and the the vibe that was created by just the sound sonically itself would have done enough to have called it master of puppets for me like it wow man that was a ride i&amp;#39;ve been missing out metallica you were nox hill certified

synthesizers and continuing with my depeche mode album review series this is violator part 5. hello and welcome to the most in-depth depash mode album review series ever conducted by an independent youtuber now if you&amp;#39;ve not seen parts one two three and four in the words of mrs norris get out of here god did it damn get out of here and go watch those parts and then come back to this one and if you are up to date then please bring your chair closer bring your favorite drink and let&amp;#39;s geek out about this now france walker vulcan is so important in the violator record the production and the sound of it very often when records come out um it&amp;#39;s not often that the you know the mix engineer gets so much appraisal really um but this is one of those rare records where even fans who are not in the production world will know the name francois kovalken and that is why i feel we definitely need to dedicate a video especially to francois kovalken and the great work he did on the violator album before we jump into this video i want to thank our sponsor who is helping us keep the lights on and that is skillshare guys you know i will never endorse or get

you can get skillshare premium for a limited period you&amp;#39;ve got nothing to lose so get into it right away a big thank you to my friends there is skillshare okay let&amp;#39;s jump into today&amp;#39;s video as i said in the beginning of this video that francois vulcan is a name which is well known in the the pashmo community remember that when records come out you know it&amp;#39;s the fans now often only know the artist and possibly the producer um but depeche mode indeed the depash mode universe is is the institution of depeche mode as i call it it&amp;#39;s that rare situation where um depash mode has not only inspired a lot of people to become musicians and producers but also the community that are not in the production industry you know just just just the sort of hardcore devotee or fan they tend to know you know who the the producers were and the engineers and that is very unusual about the whole sort of depash mode universe and francois cavalcan is just that name this video is not going to be very long because what can we say about franz walker vulcan&amp;#39;s input into violator except that it is brilliant and it is genius and i know that these words get thrown around a lot but i cannot emphasize enough the importance of franz walker vulcan this is nothing to take away from the brilliant songs that martin wrote remember the songs are the most important thing really remember you cannot polish a turd and indeed this violator period martin provided some of his best quality work in fact if you watch the documentary on the remasters series you will see everyone from gareth jones dave bascombe all the way up until their publicist promoters andy franks everyone everyone&amp;#39;s saying that violator is their favorite album even martin gall said that so it&amp;#39;s no surprise is it i will go on to say that if francois never mixed this i still believe that this would be a a monstrously successful record but then again we don&amp;#39;t know because you know as a mix engineer you&amp;#39;re not only mixing something you&amp;#39;re bringing your creativity to this and francois um had a not only a lot of experience but he has a tremendous natural gift he was born on the 10th of january 1954 he is french and he moved to the usa in 1975 i believe so he&amp;#39;s lived there most of his life in indeed if you watch his documentaries or interviews with him he has a he&amp;#39;s a new yorker it is well documented and daniel miller said this on a documentary that it was quite frustrating to work with francois because you never knew what he was doing because i think for long periods of time he would disappear into a corner with a set of headphones and he&amp;#39;d be going you know whatever he was doing and and that&amp;#39;s frustrating because then you know it&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s the natural sense of curiosity with a human being if i&amp;#39;ve got headphones on and i&amp;#39;m going you&amp;#39;re going like what what let me hear so i can imagine them they&amp;#39;d finish the record and francoise was in a corner with some headphones and as daniel said it was frustrating because uh you could you know you could never hear what he was doing daniel miller also went on to say that france was probably the most meticulous mixer he&amp;#39;s ever worked with martin gall went on to say that uh uh francois would spend you know let&amp;#39;s say two weeks on a hi-hat but martin did say but when you heard that hi hat it was a very good hi-hat so francois cavalcan was fundamentally a dj if you study the history of rock and roll and popular music you will find that a lot of the top mix engineers started off as djs and that&amp;#39;s no surprising really i think being a dj um you know a good dj there are djs and there are djs but a good dj um usually someone who understands music and they listen to a lot of music and i think a lot of those those types of djs they will then go on to producing music and mixing hence in the case of francois kovalken and he has you know dj&amp;#39;s some of the biggest clubs paradise garage studio 54 and he&amp;#39;s mixed some of the greatest artists in our generation including uh the smith&amp;#39;s adamant craft work uh pet shop boys of course the patch mode diana ross you two and gloria estefan come and shake your body baby do that conga no you can control yourself any longer feel the rhythm of your body getting stronger gloria estefan oh my god [Music] yeah gloria has the phone i know i mean just look at the selection there the smith&amp;#39;s adam and croft work pet shop boys the peshmerga gloria that&amp;#39;s the fun [Music] this just shows how diverse his ear is and his work catalog and indeed when i interviewed gareth jones and dave bascombe both of them said that violator is the record that they admire the most um we all know that um i&amp;#39;ve heard a rumor i heard a rumor they travel sorry guys i&amp;#39;m honored today um i i don&amp;#39;t know if it was gary newman but it may have been gary newman correct me if i&amp;#39;m wrong who said when he heard violator he became depressed because he just thought how is he going to get to that level and and indeed violator is that record which i&amp;#39;ve introduced a lot of people to it is a topic of discussion not only on the channel here but also in the students that i coach um whether they&amp;#39;re depeche mode fans or not i always get them to listen to it violator is a what i like to call an attack on the on the sensors it isn&amp;#39;t it is ear candy it is not only the great songs that martin wrote and the beautiful soundscapes that were produced by flood and alan wilder but also the final cherry on the top is the great mixing which is done by francois and i&amp;#39;m going to put some links below i want you to watch that that is your homework there are three links that i&amp;#39;m going to place they&amp;#39;re on youtube there&amp;#39;s the france francois cavalcan holier than thou approach and then there&amp;#39;s also this one which i like the france walker vulcan pump mix and there&amp;#39;s those are on personal jesus and then of course there&amp;#39;s the francois kovalken uh hands and feet mix of enjoy the silence now on the subject of enjoy the silence i&amp;#39;m putting this question out to you because i&amp;#39;m sure one of my super duper geeks or super devotees in the community here will be able to answer me this question and if you look at the credits on violator you will notice that the entire album is mixed by francois kovalken except for enjoy the silence now i&amp;#39;ve heard many reasons to why that is the case but i&amp;#39;ve never heard a reason that uh sort of i can put down to being the conclusive correct reason because i&amp;#39;ve heard so many different versions and i&amp;#39;m hoping we can you know put this this myth to bed now the story that i know goes something along the lines of francois had mixed the album but the band were not entirely happy with enjoy the silence they liked it but they preferred the cassette mix that flood did and then apparently daniel miller went on to replicate the the mix that flood did you know using the cassette as a reference is that the story there is another version of that where i heard that basically the the version that flood did was untouchable and they decided to go with that i&amp;#39;m not sure but i would love to know the answer to that and i&amp;#39;m sure a few of you know that so please leave your answer in the description below but indeed it was the hands is it the hands and feet mix by franz welcome balkan listen to it i mean i heard this many years after the violator record um and here&amp;#39;s a question you know if the hands and feet mix is the sort of sonic version that francois came up with how do you think it compares to the the daniel miller mix which is on the violates album interesting question and i&amp;#39;d love to know your input on that francoise ability to really lose himself in his craft a lot of people have said it&amp;#39;s down to the fact that he is autistic now i don&amp;#39;t know how true that is whether he is or not but i do know i have known quite a few friends through my time who have been on the autistic spectrum and you know although autism was sometimes seen as a disability certainly to me the autistic friends i knew to me it was more like a gift okay some of them had these inabilities to express themselves in social surroundings but they had these abilities to whatever it was to really zone into something and just be a master of it so if francois cavalcan is autistic and i believe he is um i believe that that could be one of the reasons why he was so great at what he did just like our friend gary newman who we talk about a lot on this channel he has asperger&amp;#39;s syndrome now full disclosure i&amp;#39;m no expert on asperger&amp;#39;s or autism and things like that i am very fascinated by it because i had friends who had it and they they just had this insane ability to be able to block everything out and single-mindedly focus on a task and just the results were mind-blowing so i don&amp;#39;t know if francois was autistic or is autistic i believe he is but um and that could indeed be one of the reasons why he is so intense about what he does and why he&amp;#39;s so brilliant at it at the same time violator i&amp;#39;ve said many times can be enjoyed for so many reasons it&amp;#39;s not only a record for the fans it is a record for the producer it is a record for the mix engineer it is up there for us to aspire to you know when you&amp;#39;re mixing and you just want a reference as to what a record should sound like when it reaches the realms of perfection put violator on and you&amp;#39;ll go okay now i&amp;#39;m depressed my record sucks do yourself a favor and just go on to francois cavalcan&amp;#39;s wikipedia page or discogs and notice all the records which he&amp;#39;s mixed and you will see things like the red rose from you know arcadia you know a favorite that is always recommended to me here on the channel craftwork uh you know violator obviously eurasia eurasia um and of course gloria [Music] right you&amp;#39;ve probably not learned much about francois kovalken from this video of course that&amp;#39;s not the intention this being a discussion channel we&amp;#39;re discussing i just wanted to give him a shout out for the outstanding work he&amp;#39;s done now we&amp;#39;re currently on part five and you do know that when we get into the songs we&amp;#39;re going to do one song per episode now there are nine tracks on violator so i didn&amp;#39;t initially say that this series was going to be over 10 episodes uh well we&amp;#39;ve done five already plus another nine yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s heading for 20 parts but as i said i don&amp;#39;t want to leave any stone unturned and now i&amp;#39;ve got some more good news for you i&amp;#39;m going to be interviewing a one of the engineers that was on the violator album and i&amp;#39;m going to try and pronounce his name he&amp;#39;s an italian uh engineer and his name is pino and his surname is uh pesha tola pino pesha tola he was one of the engineers involved in in in the production of you know in the first song which was personal jesus and i can&amp;#39;t wait to get him on the channel and i want to thank my wingman and uh admin lloyd for helping me facilitate this this meeting and mr cavalcan sir if you&amp;#39;re watching i would love to interview you on this channel and um that&amp;#39;ll be a dream come true for myself and this community right guys to you watching here please leave your comments in the description below answer those questions i asked you regarding enjoy the silence you know why is it that francoise version of enjoy the silence was not used that is something i&amp;#39;ve always wanted to know the answer to anything you want to say about francois and anything you want to say about this series in general now the next episode is going to be where it gets really exciting this is where we&amp;#39;re going to start breaking the songs down the next episode will be all about world in my eyes we&amp;#39;re going to break the song down into its parts uh playing it raw on the piano as well as examining some of the iconic samples that i have from the depeche mode sample banks if you would like to see more in-depth versions of

    "genre": "Hardcore Hip Hop",
    "transcript": "hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for another album review classics week continues celebrating 50k 50k wu-tang clan enter the wu-tang 36 chambers wu-tang is a still active New York hip-hop outfit that was formed in the early 90s this is their debut LP dropped in 1993 and it&amp;#39;s been followed up with numerous studio albums since but whoo tang is one of those groups whose debut LP kind of overshadows the rest of their albums people usually don&amp;#39;t give the rest of their material the time of day even though albums like their sophomore LP wu-tang forever are pretty good but that&amp;#39;s not a huge issue since every single one of the group&amp;#39;s nine members has released solo material and a lot of that is as essential as 36 chambers like Ghostface Killah solo stuff which is my favorite out of all of the wu-tang clan&amp;#39;s solo release material fish-scale ironman supreme clientele also Raekwon with only built 4 Cuban Linx parts 1 &amp;amp; 2 ol Dirty Bastard with the return of the 36 chambers the dirty version and of course we can&amp;#39;t forget the jizzes Liquid Swords those are some of my favorites but no matter how much I like those albums this release is the Alpha this is where it all goes back to this is where it starts and you must start now whoo tang and this album were an essential part to the evolving face of hip-hop in the 90s this album is a move past the golden age hip-hop sounds that came out in the 80s the jazz rap and socially conscious rap sounds that were being dropped by groups like De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest in the in the very early 90s and late 80s and the West Coast sounds of gangsta rap that were being dropped at the time too by guys like Ice Cube and waa and dr. dre keep in mind this is just a really quick abridged version of this evolution there are a lot more artist sounds and albums at work here because when people talk about this era of hip-hop especially the west coast side of things groups like freestyle fellowship for example are often forgotten so in the early in mid 90s the New York hip-hop scene was reinventing itself as something much grittier tougher more aggressive and ready to battle of course there are a lot of individual New York emcees that played a role in that like nas and notorious b.i.g but wu-tang definitely stuck out and was unique in their amount of members not to say that none of these guys would have made it if they&amp;#39;ve stayed solo their entire career but wu-tang power clearly comes from strength in numbers because with nine different people and seeing on these really hard-hitting stripped down beats this album sort of gives the atmosphere the feel of a never-ending cypher a rap battle there are a couple songs here where one MC will take the spotlight Method Man where Method Man is all over that song and of course claim in the front where GZA is pretty much featured on that track but on the majority of the tracks here is just one MC after another taking turns on these beats and because of that it sounds like they&amp;#39;re way more hyped than they would be otherwise it&amp;#39;s like a competition it makes this record come off with just a lot of energy and energy that is really infectious and with tracks that have gang courses like ain&amp;#39;t nothing to [ __ ] with and these really hard hard grooves and rize&amp;#39;s beats this album has just a ton of momentum which makes it really hard for me to just not go nuts when listening to this thing and because most of this album sounds like a rap battle there&amp;#39;s a very specific kind of lyricism going on amidst these tracks hilarious insults cartoony violence a barrage of brags and non sequiturs and cultural references there&amp;#39;s about as much ferocity and testosterone on this as like a hardcore punk record so there&amp;#39;s no question that enter the wu-tang is meant to be raw rugged dirty and stoned but it&amp;#39;s music you know it&amp;#39;s entertainment there&amp;#39;s no reason to take a lot of the violence and bragging on this LP that seriously because it&amp;#39;s so outlandish and ridiculous the real goal here is just to kind of be extreme and out there which i think is definitely highlighted on a sketch that comes before the song Method Man where they&amp;#39;re kind of going back and forth talking about torture and another clear goal here is just to be clever funny witty if you can get into the lyricism on this thing you&amp;#39;re going to hear a lot of great wordplay and a lot of fantastic quotables and to add another level of greatness to this record I love that every single emcee on this thing comes into these tracks with a different sound and a different style I hate it when I&amp;#39;m listening to a rap track and it&amp;#39;s got two three four MCS on it and they all sound the same none of them have any flavor you can&amp;#39;t really pull anybody out is being any kind of specific or bold thing not the case here everyone on this album has their own angle Ghostface Killah is the most hyped MC out of all of them he mostly works in the upper register of his voice throws out a lot of battle raps the GZA is extremely cunning and clever in the rhymes he chooses Raekwon has this nice rasp to his voice and he pulls out a lot of vivid street life imagery Method Man has this really kind of partytime attitude he&amp;#39;s really chilled out laid-back looking for a good time at every possible direction and ol Dirty Bastard who I think isn&amp;#39;t the most lyrical here but he&amp;#39;s the most fun to listen to he combines rapping with this really weird kind of off kazoo like it&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s nuts or he was rather he&amp;#39;s got this really low voice he slurs all of his words he&amp;#39;s like a rabid dog now let&amp;#39;s talk about the beats a little bit I guess the beats on this thing definitely helped bring wu-tang together into this aesthetic of course there was kind of a battle rap cypher thing going on amongst these tracks but there was also a certain sound to the music behind the rapping of course the name of the group is a tribute to old kung fu movies and that definitely gets brought home in a lot of the samples and clips of dialogue from these films too in the lyrics there&amp;#39;s a lot of talk of swordplay and martial arts and it really kind of brings this album a huge sense of of camaraderie like you&amp;#39;re coming up against a gang of lyrical ninjas in a hip-hop dojo but overall the beats here I think it&amp;#39;s just kind of a case of of less is more because it&amp;#39;s not like there&amp;#39;s a whole lot to them and not to say that they&amp;#39;re not intricate not to say that the sounds on these beats aren&amp;#39;t interesting I&amp;#39;m just saying it&amp;#39;s definitely not like a lot of modern hip-hop which is just saturated with a ton of different sounds poppin melodic catchy hooks R&amp;amp;B singers on this thing like a lot of hip-hop at the time there are ton of piano samples but RZA didn&amp;#39;t just pick some kind of sweet or soulful piano break or something like that it seemed almost as if he was choosing the most sour weird most unused melodies notes and chords that he could get his hands on because claimed in the front 7th chamber and Method Man all have really weird piano phrases laid into the beat and there are even moments like cream where all the samples come together to create something that&amp;#39;s really kind of chilled out atmospheric and eerie the drums on here have a really punchy analogue sound that&amp;#39;s really kind of typical for hip-hop at that time really kind of classic style and there are some songs on here that clearly sample music from the very kung-fu movies that inspire the group&amp;#39;s aesthetic - there&amp;#39;s just one unique sound after another in every one of these beats and it just adds to the aggressive and unsettling atmosphere of this album they&amp;#39;re very textured instrumentals that just leave a lot of room just make space for the lyrics for the emceeing and that&amp;#39;s perfect to me like I said these beats are just saturated with a ton of sounds like today&amp;#39;s hip-hop and not to dis where hip-hop has gone I mean I don&amp;#39;t think today&amp;#39;s hip-hop is terrible I just think it&amp;#39;s interesting when you consider how much hip-hop has changed in the almost 20 years since this album has been released so yeah on this LP there are a lot of brags battle raps and tough personalities and beats but it&amp;#39;s not like that&amp;#39;s the entirety of this album there are some spots on here that are worth kind of thinking about the deeper meaning of like the song cream which stands for cash rules everything around me and even though it sounds like a really kind of greedy and stereotypical hip-hop statement that song isn&amp;#39;t really a celebration of that it&amp;#39;s just kind of a really gritty picture of what it&amp;#39;s like to grow up poor and you&amp;#39;re in a position where making very fast illegal money seems like the only way out of that and the song tears which comes around the end of this LP is about friends and family members dying after making some bad decisions like deciding to have unprotected sex with a lot of different people or refusing to hand money over to somebody who&amp;#39;s trying to mug you at gunpoint 36 Chambers is definitely an aggressive album but it&amp;#39;s not an aggression that should make you feel threatened it&amp;#39;s an aggression that you get you pumped this thing is just a messy grimy and unbreakable 90s hip-hop album and there&amp;#39;s not much more to it than that this thing is a classic it&amp;#39;s an important part of hip hop&amp;#39;s history but if you&amp;#39;re not a hip hop fan I&amp;#39;m not going to promise to you that this thing is going to change your worldview if you haven&amp;#39;t heard this album after all 36 chambers is the archetype for a lot of the lyricism we hear in hip hop today if you haven&amp;#39;t heard this thing before and you&amp;#39;re just not all that school than 90&amp;#39;s hip hop in general try this thing out and at least get a sense for where a lot of modern hip hop&amp;#39;s ideas come from just to kind of hear them at their best for that time wu-tang 36 chambers counter chesa no one&amp;#39;s who you know is matching up the couch asta when i spit this floor it&amp;#39;s more electrical than Tesla send your support please free Cal so I could do some shows and tour your locale you could quote me here my rhymes are brand and clever I&amp;#39;m saying it now but you&amp;#39;ll be saying

    "transcript": "hi everyone Anthony fantano here internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and this video is the last review of Classics review week yay Neutral Milk Hotel In the Aeroplane Over the Sea originally I was not planning to review this album I even kind of made a video about how I wasn&amp;#39;t planning to review this album and why I was talking about the virally Infectious and sometimes ridiculous cult status that this album has I asked you guys what you thought about it and you let me know and some of you made some really convincing arguments talking about how the people who are making a mockery of this LP are in the minority and if that&amp;#39;s all I address I sort of let them win I&amp;#39;m sort of making a mountain out of the mole hill of jokes that there are around the internet in regards to this album and not making a video where I kind of focus away from those things hurts this album more than it helps it plus the thing is reviewing this album really isn&amp;#39;t that big of a deal an album is really only as important as you make it out to be so Neutral Milk Hotel was an experimental Indie and folk rock band from Rustin Louisiana they only came out with a couple albums in their very short discography and the second that they dropped just so happens to be one of the most celebrated releases in underground music released back in 1998 people still go nuts for this album and it just has this staying power that not a lot of releases see but for me it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not hard to understand why I think this album has a lot of great qualities going for it this thing has a really bold sound built out of inspiration from noise Rock from psychedelic Rock and folk music hailing from Scotland Eastern Europe and America plus there is a heavy influence coming from the &amp;#39;90s lowii rock scene contemporaries like Guided by Voices and Seido so this album definitely has a lot of influences going for it but on top of that it&amp;#39;s extremely well arranged color y arranged with singing saws and horns and accordion keyboards bag pipes as well and plus The Usual Suspects are here acoustic guitar warm heavy distorted overblown bass and some really hard-hitting drums too with all these different sounds and textures any airplane Over the Sea perfectly compliments heaviness and noise and aggression with tenderness and beauty Beauty it&amp;#39;s a style the project really built up to with a handful of demos and a debut album on Avery Island Aver is not the preferred album but it shares a lot of elements within the airplane a lot of the songs on here have similar chord progressions a very low-fi and overblown sound influences from folk music psychedelic rock music and very surreal lyricism too all it was really missing was this just cohesive theme when I listen to in the airoplane over the sea as opposed to Avery Island I feel like I&amp;#39;m really partaking in a story Plus in the airplane just had this Grand Jubilee of of horns and just all this extra instrumentation to really kind of bring it to a Next Level Plus in the airplane really has a a a daunting a daunting sadness that just is hard to deny and it&amp;#39;s hard to deny because it just does not let up almost every song on this LP looks for a different way to advance that feeling what&amp;#39;s so funny is that sometimes I don&amp;#39;t even know why this album gets me so emotional and and I guess I say I don&amp;#39;t know why because it&amp;#39;s not like I really get a clear clear and totally comprehensible story out of any one of these songs of course people have read interviews that talk about what has inspired these lyrics but what inspired these lyrics and what these lyrics actually are are two different things I just prefer to take the lyrics as they are the less you know the more disturbing they kind of become the imagery is so vivid And yet when I actually try to imagine what Jeff Mangum is singing about on these tracks it&amp;#39;s like my brain has this malfunction it&amp;#39;s like does not compute I mean how exactly does one picture a little boy in Spain playing pianos filled with flames it doesn&amp;#39;t look like that no the lyrics are really where this album hits hardest for me I think everything else on this LP is great but it wouldn&amp;#39;t add up to as much as it does if it wasn&amp;#39;t for Jeff Mangum using his lyricism to build from scratch this really surreal world of two-headed boys ghosts tomatoes and radio wire the abstract imagery on this thing is so out there sometimes it Rivals the fantasy world created in the book Alice in Wonderland the stories sometimes just feel so nonsensical but for me they have such a huge emotional impact anyway with all these themes of death and God and love and genocide and War and saving somebody&amp;#39;s life and intimacy and family and all these stories are delivered in Jeff mangum&amp;#39;s kind of Nas voice it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s weird it&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s no stomach in his voice whatsoever it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s all up here and on a good chunk of this album he&amp;#39;s like kind of straining his voice partially out of trying to reach the higher points of his register and partially because he&amp;#39;s just forcing himself to sing so hard and so loud the dude must have a massive lung capacity because if you actually try to sing along with this album you&amp;#39;ll see it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s pretty difficult so sometimes it&amp;#39;s like the dude will go a whole verse without taking a breath I know there are some people out there who don&amp;#39;t like Jeff&amp;#39;s voice and are not going to like Jeff&amp;#39;s voice but I enjoy it I think it has a unique tone to it and he&amp;#39;s on Pitch for the most part and he just showcases a lot of personality and a lot of passion another critique this album often gets is it&amp;#39;s simple simple chords Simple Songs simple Melodies it&amp;#39;s really simple but you know I think that&amp;#39;s kind of an odd point in album being bad because it&amp;#39;s simple I mean this thing is pretty folky it&amp;#39;s not exactly looking to be technical overly Progressive or anything like that but I do see the complaint you know if you&amp;#39;ve been playing guitar consistently for a year you can most likely play every single song on this album if you were handed the chords but I think the Simplicity issue is a little overblown I mean take for example the way the king of carrot flowers part part two builds up so noisily and so heavily into part three or the way the song ghost escalates towards its Finish Line not every album and band can do that stuff the greatness of these songs doesn&amp;#39;t come out in their blueprint of the the chords and the The Melodies written out on a piece of sheet music the greatness comes out and their performance take the title track for example the chords over the verses in the title track are the same exact chords to that famous doop song Earth Angel in fact they&amp;#39;re the same exact chords to that little diddy that you hear at the end of every single one of my reviews same chords same chords however Neutral Milk hotel&amp;#39;s take on these chords doesn&amp;#39;t sound anything like those two other songs it&amp;#39;s layered to be really kind of noisy and sweet with these singing saws and and a nice trumpet solo lots of fuzzy acoustic guitar strumming and I love the melody that Jeff is is belting out with his voice too all of these elements just make me feel so happy and kind of uplifted despite the fact that some of the lyrics are kind of morbid every track on this album does bring a little bit of a different feeling for me though even though the total package to me is is kind of sad personally the king of carrot flowers Parts two and three the way the song Just busts into this highspeed distorted base and drum part it&amp;#39;s really thrilling it&amp;#39;s like riding a bicycle down a really Steep Hill at 50 m an hour and you&amp;#39;ve got no breaks the song two-headed boy even though it&amp;#39;s really acoustic and stripped down there&amp;#39;s not a lot to it it sounds so urgent and just fiery the song The Fool is a great instrumental it&amp;#39;s just really lumbering it&amp;#39;s just really depressing it&amp;#39;s got this bulk in brass kind of feel to its style it&amp;#39;s like a funeral March and the song O cley later on that album makes that feeling just even heavier and all of these different emotional and Sonic highs and lows just flow together so nicely the king of carrot flowers part one is a fantastic opener it&amp;#39;s kind of like opening up a book it&amp;#39;s like the the call me Ishmael of of Indie music and the transition into Parts two and three just starts with this really kind of ominous drone it&amp;#39;s almost as if I&amp;#39;m listening to a string section in a pit Orchestra just lay on this constant note building up to something really epic the heavily arranged and instrumental fool is a great partner to the stripped down and the stripped down and simple two-headed boy the loud and Furious Holland 1945 is put up right against the slow and sounds scapy communist daughter and the track ghost just kind of breaks into this great great Untitled instrumental bit that&amp;#39;s just like a musical explosion of of bag pipes and heavy drum beats and bass and the song two-headed Boy Part Two it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just like the perfect closer it&amp;#39;s the last page complimenting the first page that was king of carrot flowers part one there&amp;#39;s just a lot of tension and release on this album a lot of hot and cold highs and lows this thing is always taking a different turn with its next track there&amp;#39;s not much else I can think to say about this album It&amp;#39;s just fantastic it&amp;#39;s cohesive there&amp;#39;s a lot of different flavors on here as well thematic anthemic memorable surreal and ambitious and it brings a range of different feelings out of me it just excites me it depresses me it inspires me and soothes me Allin one 40-minute listen I think it&amp;#39;s a great album I&amp;#39;m going to continue loving the hell out of it for the foreseeable future and you know keep in mind I&amp;#39;m not saying you have to like it I&amp;#39;m not saying you have to think it&amp;#39;s amazing I&amp;#39;m not saying you have to buy into the hype I think this album has its flaws sure if you like your songs to be more straightforward more readable less kind of abstract I could understand that if you like your music to be a little more complicated a little more Progressive I can understand that but what&amp;#39;s important is that if you haven&amp;#39;t heard this album take a listen to it and form your own opinion what is this album mean to you how does it make you feel let me know Anthony fantano Neutral Milk Hotel in the airplane Over the Sea forever [Music]"

    "transcript": "hi everyone one more than a time tan oh here the Internet&amp;#39;s sniffily Asst use ik nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for review of the classic album from Daft Punk discovery yes ladies and gentlemen I am filming and recording this review at the time of classics week so this is a classic review let&amp;#39;s go this is the 2001 album from the legendary French electronic music duo Daft Punk aka Thomas Bangalter and guy-manuel de homem-christo discovery was the duo&amp;#39;s second record and you could say that much of the music world was sitting waiting to see what thomas and guy would do with this record considering they had just proven themselves to be one of the newest hottest things and dance music with their last record thanks to major singles like the funk and around the world which by the 2000s had far outlasted a lot of the house music trends that those tracks rode in on now by 2001 dance music hadn&amp;#39;t dissipated in fact it kind of expanded especially thanks to the vast improvements in music recording technology in the 2000s I mean for frame of reference the 90s for the most part were one major electronic music phenomenon after another and the decade really saved some of the biggest and the best for last I mean we had mobis play shares believe also Fatboy Slim eurodance this decade also being the creative peak for IDM as well and some of the biggest dance music hits and albums of the early 2000s were being recorded by the likes of Madonna Basement Jaxx and Ricky and Glacia Skye Lehmann no Crystal Method The Chemical Brothers Nelly Furtado let&amp;#39;s not forget sono as as much as I would like to let&amp;#39;s also not forget the deluge of remix CDs many artists came out with around this time many of which would feature  mixes and did I say Jamiroquai I think I said Jamiroquai also several years down the road James Murphy would be singing about Daft Punk playing at his house and gorillas would be releasing Demon Days which in my opinion is a record that is pretty fantastically inspired by the smooth driving grooves of Daft Punk&amp;#39;s music I mean the song dare off this does sample revolution 909 from Daft Punk&amp;#39;s homework now while Daft Punk&amp;#39;s discovery is not the last great house album it almost serendipitously sits at the end of an era where numerous shades of electronic music had this massive breakthrough into the public consciousness house in Chicago house and techno and jungle break beat big beat friggin drum and bass drilling bass all of which are groundbreaking all of which are great but guy and Thomas were kind of presented with a unique opportunity with this record because a lot of the electronic dance music artists on the more mainstream side of things weren&amp;#39;t always writing music for an album audience there was just as much emphasis if not more probably more on the single or the remix than the album itself which is really not surprising that&amp;#39;s mostly how electronic dance music is marketed today but that&amp;#39;s still a major reason as to why discovery stands out as an artistic statement in electronic music today that not only guy and Thomas groomed this thing to flow like a well-crafted pop or rock record but also that Daft Punk introduced this massive element of showmanship in their music by bringing on the iconic robot helmets and suits that we know them for today also a couple of years down the road I guess in an effort to creatively give the record a second wind Daft Punk came out with the animated film interstellar 5555 the thing was about the length of the album itself the budget was four million dollars it was inspired by Japanese anime and the production was overseen by anime and manga artist Lee G Matsumoto the visuals locked up really nicely with the pacing of the record and even though there&amp;#39;s not really any dialogue on this thing the storyline is pretty clear like a bit of a commentary on the music industry itself with the story basically being about the abduction and exploitation of this alien pop band and the movie might also be a bit of an acknowledgment of Daft Punk&amp;#39;s transformation themselves into I guess a final form of sorts while this is not daft punk&amp;#39;s first foray into film it was certainly more interesting aesthetically pleasing and cohesive than a story about dogs androids firemen and tomatoes like look at that makeup look at that friggin dog it looks like a bad 80s movie so I&amp;#39;ve established that discovery had a lot going for in terms of showmanship in terms of context in terms of visuals and promotion but the album&amp;#39;s music was and still remains its greatest asset now while this record is not a total departure from the Chicago house sound that put the duo on the map with their first record it is a change of pace they kind of expand or vary their style a bit to include the shades of pop and disco and funk that inspire them in the first place but they kind of encased it in this sleek futurist robotic veneer so in other words give audiences what you already know they like especially if it&amp;#39;s something that you think they might be a nostalgic for and then present it in a way where it feels brand new so new that it&amp;#39;s like a glimpse of something that hasn&amp;#39;t even happened yet now not all critics saw the genius of this record upon its initial release of The Guardian I think spanked it with two stars Village Voice gave it a see pitchforks infamous six point four review seemed more off handed than engaged and I get it Daft Punk&amp;#39;s very repetitive and hip driven formula on this record probably did not speak to raucous sentiments at the time very well and even some listeners who enjoyed this thing maybe didn&amp;#39;t even get just how studied and experienced the music on this record was but discovery at least to my ears at the time was very obviously not your average commercial generic soon to be forgotten dance music product sure maybe one more time may have had a somewhat incessant vocal line but the flawless grooves and dreamy horn loops and gummy bass lines are just out of this world calling on them for being too repetitive for the first leg of a mere five minute song is I don&amp;#39;t know kind of like saying that James Brown live recordings are too repetitive especially considering the dramatic vocal breakdown in the middle of the track and the fantastic build-up that takes off from there and the auto-tune vocals on this thing are really nice they kind of give the the track be slightly robotic feel that Daft Punk typically bring to a track now as is their style as is their calling card Rome Anthony&amp;#39;s singing on the track is really good but it sounds even cooler with the auto-tune on as his singing sort of makes these hard digital transitions from one note to the next as his vocals ascend and descend this is part dance song part pop Odyssey and Daft Punk&amp;#39;s inspiration to do this wasn&amp;#39;t completely without precedent think back to the great disco records that inspired the duo disco or at least the best disco wasn&amp;#39;t all just throttle look at a before example with a lot of Abbas best tracks you didn&amp;#39;t just have a dance groove you had a narrative you had an element of Jarama grand instrumental presentation I think Daft Punk was very much on the same tip when you have a track on here like aerodynamic which eventually breaks down at some point to bring in these squawky NAT note guitar arpeggios that build up into a great final piece of the song or on superheroes whose vocal samples kind of break down eventually to introduce these really sleek very cool robotic synth arpeggios and some very interactive lead melodies also the Moody chord progressions that are introduced all of a sudden that break up the the raw irresistible funk of the synth funk and electro funk grooves on the track short-circuit and even when Daft Punk doesn&amp;#39;t work in a grand instrumental shift in a particular track a lot of these cuts last about three minutes and change these are bite-sized Tunes the duo was clearly crafting songs for the ear of an album listening audience and somehow kept these tracks at a pop music listeners attention span the tracklist on this thing also features the groundbreaking single harder better faster stronger one of the duo&amp;#39;s most iconic tracks ever and for good reason the springy baselines the creative sample chopping and layering all the incredibly colorful shots of guitar and since but the most memorable element of this track has to be the instantly catchy and memorable robotic lead vocals work harder make it better do it faster makes us stronger maybe if you look at the lyrics on a piece of paper they don&amp;#39;t look like much but hearing them paired up with the timbre of the vocals the effects the manipulations together with the melodies it&amp;#39;s just such an amazing and memorable mantra and the structure of this track is fantastic it&amp;#39;s just like an on the edge of your seat dance gassim with each bar so finely crafted and edited to make each section of the song unique it&amp;#39;s far from just your average copy and paste job job job and also I cannot do a review this record without at least mentioning for a bit the duo&amp;#39;s grand romantic statement something about us these sweet keyboards on this thing the sensual bass grooves the very cute quaint wah-wah lead melodies they deliver this serene but funky foundation for what sounds like some incredibly intimate robotic lead vocals Daft Punk also works in a love angle on the much poppier and peppier digital love which musically and vocally I think has always had some pretty obvious similarities to the Buggles New Wave hit video killed the radio star but nearly every track on this thing has its own style its own flavor its own direction giving this tracklist a very versatile flow the song night vision is a very nice interlude point on the album the song various quote seems pulled right out of the Giorgio Moroder playbook it sounds like part 80s sci-fi soundtrack part 70s electro disco hit and in a lot of ways the song face to face brings back a lot of the punchy beats and and clunky sample edits and chops that made the duo&amp;#39;s first record so great except this time it&amp;#39;s a bit more refined but more cleanly put together a bit more detailed and has a great lead vocalist on it to the 10-minute song too long that finishes the entire album off is is really the only track that you could probably say goes a little long although my main critique of it has to be that the lead vocals on the cut are little too human in tone like they could have been manipulated or changed up a little bit in some way to kind of give it that Daft Punk feel still though the intro builds a nice tension there&amp;#39;s a nice changeup in the middle point of the track the ending is pretty climactic all in all the album just ends as strong as it finishes and just goddamn what a great electronic music record what a great dance album and dance album really for the ages a dance album that&amp;#39;s so good like even so many years down the road it still doesn&amp;#39;t even really sound at a date there&amp;#39;s probably numerous places where you could work many songs off of this thing into a DJ set and they&amp;#39;ll still go over really well so classic record incredible record the production the sounds the ambition the grooves the cutting-edge aesthetic so well put together and still stellar to this day and most likely for many days to come Daft Punk discovery transition have you given this album a listen why is it so cold out why is there so much snow I hate it I want it to be warm I want to go outside and enjoy the sunlight over here next to my head is another review that you should check out or click on

best series where I go over the core studio albums of a particular artist and I rank those records from worst to the best and obviously in this episode we&amp;#39;re talking about Bjork legendary Icelandic singer songwriter producer arranger I&amp;#39;m going to be spanning the entirety of her studio album career though not you know the cool stuff and the sugar cube stuff and you know all the all the other stuff though I do recommend you try out those albums if you get a chance and listen even sticking to Bjork&amp;#39;s albums from debut up until now it was really tough making this list because Bjork is a unique talent and every record she has ever put out has a totally different sound palette and style and looking across her entire discography Bjork has never really come out with an awful album so even as I do rank these records from worse to best keep in mind the differences in quality from each record is pretty miniscule okay let&amp;#39;s go Volta Bjork&amp;#39;s 2007 album commonly regarded as her weakest release and I can&amp;#39;t really disagree personally I have difficulty getting into a lot of the tracks on this thing and on top of it contextually this album doesn&amp;#39;t really seem to hold much significance in Bjork&amp;#39;s discography either the 2000s were really interesting time for Bjork she was pretty much riding a high of Fame and critical acclaim after an amazing run of albums from 1993 debut all the way up until Vespertine she pretty much had veteran status in the music industry a hardcore fanbase so she began to embark on some of her most ambitious musically and conceptually albums yet and volta is one of those albums however it is arguable that this album is we&amp;#39;re a lot of Bjork&amp;#39;s ideas don&amp;#39;t translate all that effectively even if on paper it looks like it should be a total firework show because you have some production on this thing from the likes of Timbaland a lot of very punchy and experimental beats pretty raw vocal performances rather than that of what was on her latest couple of albums at the time like there are a few spots on this album that to me read as aggressive as some of her days in cuoco you also have guest vocals from a note nior Antony as she was known as at the time a 14 piece brass ensemble and some of York&amp;#39;s most politically charged lyrics ever like on the track earth intruders or the very revolutionary declare independence however on this album I find some of the brass mixing to run a little thin not add quite as much to the album as I would have liked or you have cuts on this thing where the horns just completely take over and the end result is just kind of this blobby mess of vocals and in horn sections that are very slow very frigid somewhat lifeless and some of the politics on this record come off a bit like sloganeering it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a little all over the place too not quite as pointed as maybe I would have liked and I didn&amp;#39;t really feel like the vocal chemistry with a note me on this thing was really there either despite Bjork&amp;#39;s apparent love of her vocal talents however there are some incredibly bold moments on this album that I think are amazing namely the song innocence which is one of the most insane Bjork songs ever I can&amp;#39;t even begin to explain this tracks anatomy the squelching synthesizers and what sounds like repeated samples of a gun firing and a person getting shot some very thumpy kick drums and one of York&amp;#39;s most catchy vocal lines ever there are quite a few cool moments on the album just like this but I feel like overall the record just did not go far enough or that this very bold and groundbreaking sound really should have been kind of the guiding rod for the entirety of the album so while there are some songs and ideas on this album that I just think are great I do have to ask myself is the album all over the place are the concepts narrative Lee and sonically executed all that well are they delivered consistently when I think about these things I do have to come to the conclusion that this is really my least favorite Bjork album and as she continues to release more records it just seems to carry less and less weight in her discography utopia Bjork&amp;#39;s ninth studio album falling relatively low on the list but I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s a bad record and maybe this album will grow on me with time I do think this record has some interesting ideas and to sound all its own in Bjork&amp;#39;s Canon given the nature sound effects and the woodwind ensemble that she enlisted for this album some of the tracks on this album as a result of these things are stunningly beautiful transcendent mind-bending as I said in my review I feel like I&amp;#39;m listening to some kind of space-age flute Orchestra performing in a bird sanctuary but this album is also one of her most cumbersome standing at 70 minutes in length also this record is kind of a weaker follow-up to her 2015 album vuln Akira from which she extended a lot of the themes of heartbreak and divorce and romance into slightly awkward and in very bitter territory at times which is occasionally to this album&amp;#39;s benefit but occasionally not as much sometimes Arcas production on this record which it should be noted this is like the closest and most consistently she&amp;#39;s worked with a single producer in a very long time considering just how much are kaput into this record and the previous album volnek era however I much preferred Arcas input on that album as opposed to utopia over here because sometimes our cos beats run a little messy and cluttered and and really an oppressive way smother the dynamics of Bjork&amp;#39;s vocals and also the flutes that were brought into this record and as far as musical and narrative concepts in the Bjork discography go utopia is is not one of her most fully realized but it&amp;#39;s still relatively consistent I just think there are other albums she&amp;#39;s put out that offer more seamless listens it&amp;#39;s not a Bjork album I would recommend right off the bat for beginners but still pretty decent volnek kira 2015 album Bjork&amp;#39;s eighth studio record the predecessor to utopia both emotionally and somatically given that that album was building off of the breakup that this record is about this album is pretty much Bjork&amp;#39;s breakup album because the lyrics on this thing literally go over the demise and aftermath of a long-term relationship that she had with artist matthew barney and this is easily one of her most painful and sad albums I guess I do get the sense on this album that I am being transported somewhere much like I do on a lot of other Bjork Records but in this instance it&amp;#39;s to a very dark very paralyzing place specifically on tracks like family and then Black Lake and while this album is a much more somber side of Bjork you can almost hear in a very subtle way that she&amp;#39;s going back to the very lavish and very organic instrumentation that that palette that she had going on with mm one&amp;#39;s Vespertine which was a record that was inspired by the the love and positivity that she was feeling for this very same relationship at the time but now these very wintery sounds that inhabited that album are so dark and they&amp;#39;re so negative the production input from ARCA on this album is very tasteful very subtle occasionally results in a lot of very intriguing glitchy beats we also see the return of a note neon this album to who I think Bjork gels with vocally so much better here than on volta so while this album is not one of New York&amp;#39;s most cutting-edge records from a compositional or Sonics standpoint this is easily one of the grandest displays of emotions that she&amp;#39;s made across her entire discography that emotion just happens to come from a very dark in a somewhat more subtle place with the exceptions of tracks like not get on this thing where you can really hear in her singing the emotional trauma and all these fears and anxieties kind of compiling all at once I would also say that volnek era is one of her most theatrical albums like this is definitely a record that I could see playing on a stage show with a small pit orchestra with like some kind of silent interpretive play-acting itself out to the score I can&amp;#39;t quite put my finger on what about the album makes me feel that way but still I personally love the record I think it&amp;#39;s a great album in her discography although I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend it to a newcomer unless you were ready right off the bat to go to a very dark place debut Bjork&amp;#39;s 1993 album it&amp;#39;s sort of strange calling this a debut considering just how long york had had her feet in the music industry before the release of this album but i guess it is a debut of sorts this is one of York&amp;#39;s most celebrated albums however it is falling somewhat low on my list below the halfway point yeah and I get why people love this record it used to be one of my favorite Bjork albums but while I do like a lot of the songs on this album I can&amp;#39;t really celebrate this album as being much more than a starting point a very good starting point because while some of Bjork&amp;#39;s most notable tracks do land on this thing like Venus as a boy or human behavior in one of my personal favorite Bjork ballads does land on this thing anchor song she also has an excellent cover of the jazz standard like someone in love on this thing too however some of the tracks on this thing do and abruptly they lack structure there&amp;#39;s little in the way of Sonic cohesion across the entire record some of the instrumentals do sound kind of rickety even for the 90s truly what Bjork sounds like on this album is a burgeoning artist who is still finding her sound still finding her footing but still even at this point there are some stunningly beautiful things about Bjork&amp;#39;s music specifically her voice she still had that voice at this point very early on in her solo career and at this point it was in a very youthful and a very exciting prime and she also seemed a little more wild and I guess open to experimentation on this album too and as a fan it is pretty exciting and interesting to hear Bjork at a point in her career where she is so willing to wear her influences on her sleeve the amalgamation of music styles that would eventually carry her on to bigger and better records jazz and electronic music and dance pop and post-punk which is why if you are a newcomer to Bjork&amp;#39;s music I do recommend that maybe you kick things off with an album like debut because there&amp;#39;s a certain level of familiarity and maybe even normalcy to the music that she&amp;#39;s delivering on this album that you might take to more easily then if I were to just throw you directly into let&amp;#39;s say an album like biophilia so while I do think debut is a very good record I still think a lot of what she did on this album is is surpassed by what she delivered on post her next record and I think that&amp;#39;s everything I want to say about this album Biophilia 2011 album York&amp;#39;s seventh studio LP and one of her most ambitious concepts ever Biophilia is Bjork&amp;#39;s environmentalist opus the song subjects on this album are inspired by the likes of seasons and nature in the earth and the moon and even DNA and not only is that reflected in York&amp;#39;s lyrics but also the the literal musical composition itself in how a lot of the music on this thing sounds grand and intergalactic as well as even like very primitive and stripped back like primordial specifically on tracks like dark matter and Hollow and again the inspiration the natural world has on this album goes beyond an aesthetic level for example according to Bjork FR the song moon was composed with the literal cycles of the moon in mind uh note some of the very strange unique and custom instrumentation that went into this record - one song in particular on here the track Thunderbolt actually features a singing Tesla coil not something I think a lot of albums could boast and given the rollout of this album the performances of this record the app that was attached and release along with this album - that allowed fans and users to kind of interact with the music itself there is an interesting conceptual meld here of nature and technology the one thing I will say about biophilia though is that it is not one of York&amp;#39;s more accessible and hook and catchy albums not quite as groovy as some of her more popular works as well I myself had a somewhat lukewarm reaction to the album at first when I did a somewhat rust review of it with my wife but then girlfriend at the time it came out very cute I regret nothing still though as the years have drawn on I&amp;#39;ve realized that this is one of Newark&amp;#39;s more out-of-the-box releases also one of her most mystical and otherworldly albums - as even some of the more skeletal tracks on the track listing here ranked as the records most compelling pieces of music because there are just these beautiful ballads all over this album these beautiful ODEs to the natural world songs like virus and Moon and mutual core thunderbolt and cosmogony there are points where I do wish the album was a bit more grand instrumentally though I do appreciate some of the unique instrumentation that was included on this somewhat sparse release I personally have grown to love a lot of this album sounds and themes and I think a lot of potential newcomers will as well once they get more of a fill of maybe her other records Bjork&amp;#39;s second album here post 1995 release now as I stated earlier in the video when I was talking about debut I feel on this album New York was just kind of building off a lot of what she was doing on that album delivering on to fans an album that was just as versatile building out a lot of the same musical inspirations but just more fully realized Bjork&amp;#39;s vocal performances on this album while they are not nearly as animated and as wild as they were on debut they are certainly more masterful and authoritative commanding and angelic yet also kind of alien the instrumentation on this thing was immaculate but still relatively down-to-earth like it was still very clear that she was grabbing a lot of influences from art pop and alternative dance music and trip-hop and there are some tracks on this album where Bjork begins to dip her toes into the huge gargantuan soaring and transcendental balladry that she would basically perfect on homogenic a few years later personally I love posts I think it&amp;#39;s one of York&amp;#39;s better records and the enjoyability of this album for me really comes down to just each song individually being great it&amp;#39;s just a really well put together very cutting edge very imaginative set of art pop songs which was not just capitalizing on but also advancing pushing forward a lot of the musical trends at the time things like house music and a lot of the more contemporary fusions of electronic music and pop but pulled off with this mountainous arranged instrumentation in this vocal style that you&amp;#39;re only gonna get out of Bjork album oh yeah and there&amp;#39;s also another amazing jazz cover on this album - a rendition of the song it&amp;#39;s oh so quiet Bjork steak on this track is wonderfully theatrical and freaky one of my favorite moments on the entire album I love the ritzy instrumentation and the in the walking bass line on this track the horn section is wonderful too but yeah this is one of my favorite Bjork records to me this album it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like futuristic bangers from the 90s if you give this record a shot I highly recommend tracks like army of me or enjoy tracks that to me push pop music to the brink with some very subtle nods and stuff like industrial but really the bread and butter of this album are these incredibly dynamic and and amazing ballads that to me just sound futuristic even today hyper ballad Isabel modern things these tracks that feel like these enchanted string kissed anthems meanwhile tracks like possibly maybe and you&amp;#39;ve been flirting again serve as a reminder that nobody does a love song quite like Bjork the closing track headphones is one of the sleepier numbers on the album and kind of gives a music appreciation angle to the romance thing so again posts for me is just one fantastic track after the next it might not have the same conceptual impact as a lot of the other records that she&amp;#39;s dropped over the years but that doesn&amp;#39;t really matter to me when you have songs that are this good when you have a tracklist that is this consistent and flows this well and post was still ahead of the curve in a lot of ways even if it was just the tip of the iceberg of the musical boundaries that be or could be pushing down the road next on my list we&amp;#39;re essentially in the top three here is Bjork&amp;#39;s 2004 album medulla placing pretty high here even if for a lot of music fans over the years this record has been kind of difficult to swallow because personally I feel like this is one of York&amp;#39;s most bold and daring albums following the very lavish and synthetic Vespertine Bjork decided to take things pretty experimental and a very vocal direction resulting in what I think is is maybe Bjork&amp;#39;s most interesting and in fully-realized instrumental concept and that is an album that is is largely based around the human voice to the point where nearly all the instrumentation you hear on this thing comes out of a human&amp;#39;s mouth so you have a London choir on here an Icelandic choir third singer Tania to gawk someone listed as a human trombone you have beatboxers on here as well as mike patton of Faith No More fan Tomas mr. bungle Fame there&amp;#39;s a lot of instrumentation on this album a lot of the mixes on this thing are pretty dense and because again it&amp;#39;s largely based around the human voice Bjork needed a lot of personnel on this album there are a few tracks a few tracks on this thing to have a little bit of piano a little bit of synth bass but a lot of the time what you&amp;#39;re hearing on this record is the human voice even if some parts of it are just electronically edited to make the pattern sort of sync up especially the rhythms the beatboxing now as a result of that this album is gonna sound odd to a lot of people it&amp;#39;s most likely gonna be a challenging listen for a lot of newcomers it&amp;#39;s been a challenging listen over the years for people who even appreciate New York&amp;#39;s music and I guess I myself while I love love love love love this album I do hesitate to call it a perfect album some of the beatboxing does still feel a little awkward to me to this day it does take some getting used to and occasionally I think the mixing of the vocals leaves a little bit to be desired because you do have a limited frequency range in the human voice and you have so many human voices in the mix at once it can get just a little muddied especially on tracks like where is the line still though it&amp;#39;s pretty easy for me to overlook a lot of the flaws on this album given just how groundbreaking and sharp some of the songs on this thing are I would also like to give Bjork some long overdue credit for embarking on these vocal experiments in a way that was that was very very risky before groups such as tune-yards or Dirty Projectors or Animal Collective would would popularize this very thing maybe without the beatboxing but still but a lot of highlights on this album a lot of highlights I love the wonderfully strange and and intriguing throat singing and hyperventilating on the song ancestor all of these synthetic vocal manipulations and and chorus whooping on the chorus of the track Oceania and I do think some of Bjork&amp;#39;s most interesting and in stunningly beautiful songs land on this record - the song desired consolation is wonderful the track I think is one of her most well-written and hooky songs ever the song submarine as well is beautifully eerie absolutely love it I like that the songs on this album are so great they don&amp;#39;t get sort of drowned in the the odd vocal based concept of this thing they&amp;#39;re not lost in the indulgence of this album to me this is a very well written LP it&amp;#39;s got a great flow I think it has an interesting I idea concept behind it it&amp;#39;s a thrilling musical adventure and only the way Bjork could do it next on my list second - the best is Bjork&amp;#39;s 1997 homogenic a record that I place here because I think it is one of York&amp;#39;s most consistent albums one of her best written albums one of her best performed albums one of her most popular albums and in my opinion her first truly transcendental album consistently from front to back the first record where I think she hit upon a particular vibe a particular sound that would just go on to define almost the entirety of her career from here on out because what do you get on this thing you get some of the most advanced and ambitious art pop ever just very progressive cutting-edge electronics soaring string sections and vocals that are just cinematic just uh larger-than-life Bjork&amp;#39;s vocals at their most dramatic and expressive at the time the song bachelorette for example is a track of love and devotion and attraction it&amp;#39;s got a thunderous beat these juggernaut string sections Bjork singing is incredible the song has this heavy undeniable urgency to it it&amp;#39;s like the fate of the [ __ ] world depends on this romance that is the immense and intense level of emotion just pouring through on this album that we&amp;#39;re talking about here the song five years features all these distorted skipping very intricate rhythms topped with an incredible vocal performance from Bjork where she is really at one of her artists and most experimental points on the album like she&amp;#39;s just a wailing and hollering and blurting out kind of like a saxophone we have the glitchy and very robotic Pluto and the sweeping and elegant joga there&amp;#39;s something about the electronics that a few points on this album that seems like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s rudimentary or it&amp;#39;s primitive intentionally like I&amp;#39;m listening to some old craft work or something but then a lot of the vocals in the arranged instrumentation surrounding these electronics that they&amp;#39;re wrapped up in seems super advanced very very complex it&amp;#39;s like this album delivers this wonderful amazing cross-section of a lot of the more abstract and aggressive sounds coming out of electronic music and dance music at the time getting mixed with just this very dramatic very emotionally stirring art pop music because homogenic is not just one of York&amp;#39;s best albums but it is a quintessential album in the art pop genre it&amp;#39;s a quintessential album of the 90s itself and it&amp;#39;s also worth asking would mainstream music and would pop music in general sound as grand and is over the top and as ambitious as it does today if not for albums like this if not for the advancements that Bjork made on this album whatever producers mark Bell made on this album if not for the advancements of contemporaries at the time like Portishead it really is a great record with a great flow a lot of fantastic songs total groundbreaker and it&amp;#39;s one of those critically acclaimed it&amp;#39;s one of those classic records this that&amp;#39;s actually a great listen I swear to you it&amp;#39;s not just like you know people who think that they&amp;#39;re smarter than you telling you something&amp;#39;s good and that you need to like it because they tell you you need to like it but still though I do recommend that newcomers prime themselves with maybe a little bit of her earlier work to kind of build up to this point and my final album my favorite Bjork album the record that I see in her discography to be her best mm one&amp;#39;s Vespertine if homogenic was an album that basically sounded like the biggest thing on planet earth Vespertine to me is is just so gargantuan and and so otherworldly that it&amp;#39;s in another galaxy there are a lot of familiar elements on this album that that carried over from york&amp;#39;s previous LP a lot of the electronic rhythms and since some of the string sections Bjork&amp;#39;s voice as well but all this has undergone a gigantic renovation and has become so much more dynamic subtle and refined it&amp;#39;s like Bjork has found a way to mix the organic and the synthetic elements of her music on this record in such a way where it&amp;#39;s a little seamless and it becomes difficult to tell where these two worlds begin and end especially with all of these strings and and harp and celesta and music boxes on this album kind of melting into each other not to mention all of the amazing micro beats bra by the likes of Matt mousse on this album one of my favorite musical duo&amp;#39;s and I&amp;#39;m so amazed that their contributions on this record to this day sound incredibly fresh the tone of this album is consistently beautiful and inspiring it&amp;#39;s wintry it&amp;#39;s passionate as I stated earlier in this video a lot of björk&amp;#39;s inspiration for writing on this album was from the relationship that she was kicking off pretty much with Matthew Barney which given that eventual romantic demise and how it played out on records like volnek era and her latest album utopia gives this album now for me a certain kind of sting I guess it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s sort of hard to enjoy it in the same way that I used to or sort of look at it in in the same exact way but really that doesn&amp;#39;t take away from just how beautiful a lot of Bjork&amp;#39;s vocal performances on this album are how beautiful a lot of her poetry is on this album and it certainly doesn&amp;#39;t affect at all just how gorgeous I find a lot of the instrumentation on this album to be obviously in my opinion the most gorgeous of any of the album&amp;#39;s she has released so far and I&amp;#39;m gonna leave it at that guys that is my worst to best those are my favorite to least favorite Bjork albums I know that there&amp;#39;s a lot I&amp;#39;ve left out in terms of context and and background on each album but this video already took so long to make and so long to write and I felt like I kept you guys waiting long enough to do this video and and I apologize for that so there&amp;#39;s the list guys thank you very much for watching and make sure to down in the comments drop your Bjork albums from worst to best and I will see you in the next video transition over here next to my head is another worse - best list hit that up or the link to

    "score": 10,
    "date": "September 4, 2001",
    "genre": "Alternative Metal",
    "transcript": "system system up it down toxicity system of a down classic review let&amp;#39;s go this is the sophomore full-length album from California alternative metal outfit System of a Down the breakthrough record that would solidify the band as an essential figure in modern metal with singles like aerials and toxicity and chop-suey toxicity was also the band&amp;#39;s first platinum album and they would go on to sell 40 million copies worldwide of albums throughout their discography and as much as it was a part of my musical diet when I was a teenager metal music in the late 90s and early 2000s it was kind of a [ __ ] show of course anyone can retrospectively go back and cherry-pick any number of great underground releases from that time period that have withstood the test of time from opeth or Boris or Mastodon or sleep but it wouldn&amp;#39;t really give you an accurate portrait of the metal landscape at the time because all that thrash metal and groove metal it would eventually give way to some really tacky hybrids of rap and rock as well as new metal now of course there were some great groups that crafted their own sound and image during this time period your Marilyn Manson&amp;#39;s and your rage against the machines corn and Deftones and tool and Slipknot but there was still so much crap to cut through especially with each new group sounding more cookie cutter than the next putting more and more of an emphasis on either a larger visual gimmick or just trying to sell the small goth image but System of a Down was a much-needed breath of fresh air in an ocean of cringy rap verses and down-tuned to note riffs and even though the band did take a lot from the prevailing grooves and guitar tones that were popular in metal at the time they built their own little unique sound into it over the course of several great records and what made these albums stand out was their bold personality pure absurdity potent rage and infectious hooks also the band&amp;#39;s sense of melody was much greater than a lot of their other metal contemporaries they were also not shy about working their Armenian roots into their music as well through the percussion the melodies through the harmonies or even the instrumentation on a given track and I would argue that influence only got stronger as the band progressed their lyrics were political for a metal band at the time - and this dates back to their early demos and debut album while the ridiculous sugar and uncompromising ly dark spiders served as functional singles for their first record that kind of drew listeners into the cults of system of a down deeper cuts like sweet pea and war weren&amp;#39;t hesitant to dive into topics like American imperialism and religious fanaticism and the band wasn&amp;#39;t just writing music that was socially aware but socially ahead of the curve toxicities official release state was just seven days before the September 11th attacks in 2001 but the lyrics on this album were written as if they had the hindsight of the next seven years of authoritarian garbage that the Bush administration would serve up and it&amp;#39;s kind of depressing to admit that this album&amp;#39;s themes of pollution and addiction and private prisons and endless war they&amp;#39;re only more relevant now it would be an oversight on my part if I also didn&amp;#39;t mention that frontman Serj Tankian is one of the most enigmatic and expressive front men in metal ever he&amp;#39;s really the kind of singer that you only get one time in a genre and one time only as his son vocals on systems records were not only incredibly compelling but showed a ton of volume and range I really love his very nasally Tambor sits up very high in the throat but has such a strong sense of pitch meanwhile his dynamic and cartoony shrieks and growls and screams remain unmatched in metal in their energy and character meanwhile guitarist and songwriter Daron Malakian wasn&amp;#39;t shy about bringing his own vocals into the fold more and more as the band grew in popularity and this brought another interesting dynamic to their sound especially on toxicity and on toxicity you have all these elements coming together and totaling into this incredibly raw and heavy and varied sound all of its being filtered through the production lens of the legendary Rick Rubin who had also helped develop the sound of bands that inspired System of a Down like Slayer now toxicity is a pretty tight listen even for its 15 tracks because the band had the talent to allow themselves to write these fantastic anthems and mystical ballads but also these blistering two minute on slots like the bizarre jet pilot a track that even the band has admitted doesn&amp;#39;t really mean all that much and then there&amp;#39;s the very hilarious tribute to group sex on the song bounce but between the lines of eccentricity and weirdness that are placed throughout this record toxicity does deliver some very significant songs and statements like on the opening track prison song which is most likely the most effective example of straight sloganeering in a rock song but actually managing to keep it entertaining even in the midst of surge shouting crime statistics and corruption headlines in the middle of verses and choruses oddly it adds to the songs incredible sense of fear and tension meanwhile the riffs on this track are hard as friggin cement then there&amp;#39;s the harrowing deer dance which is all about police brutality especially toward peaceful protesters this track eventually progresses into imagery of kids getting pushed around with automatic rifles and even though the message and the aggression of this track are pretty bold the most breathtaking part of it is actually the super mellow bridge where you get these beautiful rustic guitar melodies toxicity also features a greater sense of spirituality especially on tracks forest and science which directly reference the environment being destroyed at the hands of human progress and technological advancement themes that are also expressed on a song atwa which stands for air trees water and animals the track is like a forlorn send-off to all the great things that the planet has given us that we&amp;#39;re slowly killing off however the songs message and title takes from the ecological credo of Charles Manson and I mean I could think of better figures who have an environmental message that you might want a reference but as far as I can tell Darren does sort of separate Charles Manson&amp;#39;s heinous actions from what he thinks about the the livelihood of our planet I guess there are quite a few cuts on this record that dive into themes of control as well whether it be more widespread and nefarious strains of it on the song shimmy which features some very odd and repetitive and simplistic lyrics but it can be gleaned pretty easily that the track is about conforming as a result of indoctrination via a fake education or even control as the result of an a or dependency on a substance like on the song needles where the band likens being addicted to having a mind controlling tapeworm stuck in you that you need to pull out of your ass oh the tapeworm out of your addiction is also in the spotlight on the most popular song on this record chop suey which is kind of lost in translation in the songs fragmented narrative as well as the band not being able to name the song after the self-righteous suicide reference in the hook and instead having to call it chop suey if you listen very closely at the start of the song you can hear we&amp;#39;re rolling suicide making reference to the original title of the track but this song essentially boils down to a conflict between two people one person who obviously has a problem and they&amp;#39;re doing everything that they can to hide it and just keep it under wraps either that or just not deal with it and meanwhile we have an antagonist who&amp;#39;s trying to expose this problem take this person to task over this problem this judgment and this pressure eventually drives this person to suicide that almost kind of turns into like a religious experience over the bridge where they&amp;#39;re basically crying out to God why have you forsaken me it&amp;#39;s pretty heavy stuff and much heavier than I think a lot of the young listeners this song appealed to appreciate it at the time especially since the track has been kind of covered and replayed so much that it&amp;#39;s lost all meaning then there&amp;#39;s the gorgeous and haunting title track which culminates a lot of the album&amp;#39;s ideas on losing touch with nature and spirituality and humanity essentially getting sucked into this modern overprescribed society there&amp;#39;s also a mental health angle to it as well meanwhile the closing track ariel&amp;#39;s reaches an even larger emotional and instrumental climax with tons of soaring vocal harmonies and strings and grand guitar chords the lyrics on this track exploring themes of oneness as well as isolation and putting up walls basically needing to throw out small mindedness and egoism to attain real freedom eerily odd how much this record kind of goes against the grain of a lot of the prevailing politics of the past few years though I guess back then things weren&amp;#39;t really all that different the only thing that&amp;#39;s changed now is the factor has been multiplied pretty greatly overall toxicity is animées album a metal record that I don&amp;#39;t not love a single song on it is a beautiful and also a brutal record too it&amp;#39;s ridiculous yet also deadly serious it&amp;#39;s nuanced and complex and then also in another breath it&amp;#39;s just grossly aggressive and primal and that&amp;#39;s because this record like many great ones that came before it has a fantastic duality to it arguably one of the best metal records of the past twenty years one of the best metal albums alternative metal has ever brought to the table and certainly a masterpiece from a band whose prime music making years were cut kind of short transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should I review next hit the like if you like

    "transcript": "hi everyone Anthony fantano here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and we&amp;#39;re starting off Classics week where we&amp;#39;re talking about some popular beloved older records that I don&amp;#39;t normally talk about on this channel taking sort of a break you know little bit of a break from the news stuff talking about some older stuff we&amp;#39;re just going to kick things off with mad villain mad villainy mad villain is the infamous pairing of mc/ producer MF Doom and producer slmc madlib and the one single album they released together in 2004 just happens to be pretty much the most celebrated abstract hip-hop album ever this LP has proven to be pretty influential to a lot of upcoming MC&amp;#39;s lyrically stylistically conceptually instrumentally but even if this album influ infuenced no one it would still be an extremely potent unique creative strange and pretty Oddball hip-hop album with a strong personality let me list off uh a handful of things that sort of make this album stick out to me for one the continual non-stop flows that MF Doom throws out on one track after another passing for the most part on choruses on many of these songs which are pretty brief and the flow that he uses on this album as well as almost every other project MF Doom has ever been involved in is pretty hypnotic and I feel like what also kind of makes that sort of entrancing characteristic come out is definitely Doom&amp;#39;s very dark deep and grimy voice usually MC&amp;#39;s that repeat a flow this often get a lot of [ __ ] and and just you know don&amp;#39;t get any respect and I feel like MF Doom has taken this thing that that would usually be a negative aspect and turned it into a kind of unique characteristic when he spits he goes pretty much 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 rest like an eighth note rest or even like a 16th note rest and then goes back into it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 he can use a variety of different rhythms depending on what the words are that he&amp;#39;s saying in a given line but he typically likes to leave an eighth or a 16th worth of space in between one line and another line I&amp;#39;m not exactly sure why of course there are moments on this album and on other albums where he&amp;#39;ll totally skip over that beat he&amp;#39;ll sort of bring the lines a little closer together sort of erase that space entirely but he works in this meter so often that if any other MC uses it it&amp;#39;s instantly recognizable as as oh that that sounds like MF Doom now if there&amp;#39;s anything that sets MF Doom apart from other MC&amp;#39;s besides his flow his very grally Voice or his mask it is definitely his lyricism MF Doom does rap about himself like other MC&amp;#39;s do but when he does it he tends to kind of do it uh from the standpoint of a narrator he&amp;#39;ll say Doom does this Doom does that he does this he does that and of course as he&amp;#39;s referring to himself he wraps about his rapping ability writing Rhymes off Heinekens and his villainous deeds and the violence and the shenanigans that occur within his verses it&amp;#39;s all very very cartoony to me kind of in a in a wuang like way but really even going further down that road to the point where I feel like I&amp;#39;m reading a comic book or watching a Saturday morning cartoon but like for adults a Saturday morning cartoon featuring superheroes that kind of catch themselves in sexual situations or have no moral compasses whatsoever and of course this Vibe is helped along with sound clips that are very animated either sound clips that are kind of talking about this Duo of villains that&amp;#39;s sort of being edited to make it sound like the guy talking about these villains is in fact referring to Mad Lib and doom or even some clips from the Fantastic for show referring to Dr Doom who obviously MF Doom sort of you know takes his character from and even though this album does feature a plethora of sound Clips like this and that that certainly does paint a picture nothing sort of brings the image into fruition more than MF Doom&amp;#39;s lyrics like on the track curls where MF Doom opens with this line how he gets money like curls and everyone else&amp;#39;s squirrels trying to get a nut in his mad world or the song meat grinder where MF Doom goes through these extremely coded bars about this strange encounter he has with a skitso prostitute who&amp;#39;s got a little bit of a lisp or the song America&amp;#39;s most blunted where he is nominated for Rolling the best L&amp;#39;s and they wondered how he dealt with stress so well Fancy Clown kind of details a breakup MF Doom style strange ways to me kind of highlights some extreme societal hypocrisies and the ultra abstract Shadows of tomorrow which actually has Mad Lib rapping as quasim Moto over the track is is really one of my favorite songs on this entire LP it&amp;#39;s just just such a lyrical attack on the concept of time uh it&amp;#39;s sort of Mind melting like any other hip-hop album there&amp;#39;s a strong element of egoism here but it&amp;#39;s for this totally dark weird madeup character that the MF Doom puts so much effort into that he seems you know almost real lyrics are to me just one half of the magic of this LP I mean mad lib&amp;#39;s production is just freaking awesome all over this album there are a lot of jazz samples a lot of soul samples stuff that you would expect to be in hip-hop generally but in hip-hop especially if you&amp;#39;re a huge fan of many artists on the ston store records roster but still despite the fact that Mad Lib does pull from genres that are typically associated with hip-hop samples what he does with a lot of the Snippets of sound that he takes and incorporates into his Beats is just so freaking off the radar like the track accordion where you get the the like the track accordion like really a trademark track off of this LP I mean one of the major ones that everyone remembers mostly because of its quietly pulsating accordion sample humming away bringing a really interesting sound to a hip-hop beat that that wouldn&amp;#39;t normally be there I love the sharp little rhythm behind this accordion sample and the synth Baseline that comes in around 50 seconds in awesome the beat has a ton of personality but it&amp;#39;s also kind of understated a lot like MF Doom himself what I love even more than that though is the Sinister upright Baseline on the track meat grinder and that wailing sort of strange Reverb guitar that pops in occasionally and that sharp rhythm guitar and the Baseline on the track America&amp;#39;s most blunted and the drums on that thing so crispy and the track curls the the rolling Vib phone Melodies on that track it&amp;#39;s just so amazing amazingly bubbly and and fun and the way the organ Pops in later into the track I mean it feels like I&amp;#39;m listening to some kind of radio drama from the 1950s or something like that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just another awesome Sonic Edition to this track that just kind of hits you with one sound after another these songs on this LP they&amp;#39;re very very linear they don&amp;#39;t loop around from a verse to a chorus to a verse once again for the most part a a lot of the songs on here just kind of continue onward on this one Groove and kind of hit you with one new little piece of instrumentation one new sample one new little vocal snippet one new kind of change or just sort of ad lib that MF Doom throws in oh yeah I love the quickly picked guitar groove on the track Shadow Of Tomorrow the watery Sense on the track figuro and the somewhat muddy Soulful vocal sample on the track strange ways and I like the way the strings as they&amp;#39;re building up on the hook on that track I mean how they just sort of rise up it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s quite beautiful just so many unique freaking sounds on this album and even the tunes on here that that have beats that are a little more straightforward and and I guess kind of you know I guess I would say conforming to a usual hip-hop sound like the song Fancy Clown even that has some vocal samples that are cut up in a really interesting way the samples specifically come from the track zzy Hills that ain&amp;#39;t the way you make love and the way his vocals are just kind of separated throughout that track it&amp;#39;s just refreshing however this LP is not just you know rapid fire non-stop raps over Mad Lib beats there are a few tracks on here that are instrumental and believe me they are completely fine and awesome as is there is a very playful moment on here with the track beastro where MF Doom is kind of I guess sort of inviting guests who are here for the album listening it actually kind of reminds me of something that Biggie Smalls had already done although I&amp;#39;m sure the reference is completely intentional and there are a few vocal guests on here as well Meed appears on a track wildchild takes up an entire song just on his own and Stacy EPS kind of finds herself singing in a very Heavenly way through the murky darkness of mad lib&amp;#39;s MPC though these tracks do break away from pretty much everybody&amp;#39;s favorite moments on this LP where MF Doom and madlib are doing just just awesome collaborative work together they do break up the monotony of the album they do kind of become posts of this album&amp;#39;s progression it&amp;#39;s like oh okay I&amp;#39;m this far I&amp;#39;m sort of gone through this phase of the album let&amp;#39;s go into the next phase because there are quite a few tracks here 22 to be exact and it&amp;#39;s sort of like these instrumentals and sort of extra vocal guests act as separators among all these little bits all these brief songs because even though there are 22 songs on here this album doesn&amp;#39;t even break 50 minutes but even though the tracks on here are kind of short they&amp;#39;re brief they hit you with a lot of lyrical ideas and references that on the surface may appear to be very disconnected this album is anything but unfocused I would actually argue instead that this album is extremely sharp creative and refreshing I think because the ideas on here are so awesome MF Doom can present them in this kind of Rapid Fire way and they still stick as we sort of distance ourselves from the release of this album more and more I feel like mad villain proves itself to be kind of a GameChanger when it comes to abstract and underground hip-hop a sub genre that&amp;#39;s been growing and growing and growing ever since the internet has been kind of leveling the playing field in terms of who can and cannot influence hip-hop culture will there ever be another mad villain album you know I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m not really sure and the fact that we are just only having this LP to listen to I Feel Like Only builds up the intensity of of love that people have for this album even more I&amp;#39;m just going to leave it at that just going to leave it at that if you haven&amp;#39;t listened to this album do check it out Anthony fantano mad villain forever"

trick realness basically this is what I was hinting toward in that video I made about how the channel hit 50k and had the surprise and we&amp;#39;re going to sort of celebrate a little bit by reviewing a couple Classic Albums this week classic if you want to use the c-word really I&amp;#39;m just picking some of my favorites that I know are kind of well known and people will be excited about if I review them because all too often I get the question will you review some classic albums review some of your favorite albums reveal some albums at you really really love alltime favorite once 2012 starts we&amp;#39;ll get back into the recent stuff and I&amp;#39;ve already chosen the albums that I&amp;#39;m going to review this week so you know I&amp;#39;m sorry all right the first album I would like to review this week is the seminal LP from Canadian rock band godspeed You black Emperor lift your skinny fists like antennas to Heaven if this album is not their best it&amp;#39;s definitely this group&amp;#39;s most praised LP most well-known LP in their very short and consistent discography this album came out in the year 2000 and is a huge reason why these guys are kingpins in the genre of post Rock but that genre label doesn&amp;#39;t really say all that much to me since in my opinion these guys don&amp;#39;t really sound like any of their contemporaries if post rock is a genre these guys definitely put a different spin on it different than your mwse and your talk talks and your do make say thinks your explosions in the skies your monos your cigar Roes Ross if there was one artist or predecessor that I had to compare this album compare godspeed to in general it would have to be the band swans but not like 1980s Post Punk noise industrial swans more like the stuff during the latter half of their career the late &amp;#39;90s albums like soundtracks for the blind all the rising instrumentation and sampled vocals and drones and textures on this LP really reminds me of the material on lift your skinny fists even though there were hints of those ideas on godspeed&amp;#39;s previous previous efforts this album and the EP that came before it are really where these ideas got refined and tied together into these four meticulously crafted songs for the apocalypse which all kind of come together and add up to just about 90 minutes this album and post Rock both seem to have just something really cinematic about them by Nature this album features tons of rising crescendos and and quiet lows and lots of Reverb and atmosphere for added dramatic effect but these are just kind of ideas that fit that post Rock blueprint that go into this album there is so much more going on with this LP than just that there&amp;#39;s plenty of ambient music on here noise noise Rock spoken word field recordings and found sounds and samples and there&amp;#39;s just this really strong Punk fury on this album too in just how how urgent and aggressive and just socially and politically conscious this album can be as well as restless and there&amp;#39;s a really strong element of classical music on here too but you should not go into this record expecting like a symphonic rock record that&amp;#39;s definitely not where this is coming from I say classical because of of course the posos and the strings and the horns that show up on this album but all these extra sounds just come together in these highly highly detailed layers and these layers do add up to something that sounds a lot like a pit Orchestra but at the end of the day this thing is still a rock album Now lift your skinny fists it&amp;#39;s a highly highly praised album there&amp;#39;s no doubt about that but I would not call it an accessible album or an easy to list to album by any means even if you are kind of going into it expecting good things unless you already know you love drone you love ambient music and soundscapes you know you love noise and you actually have the time to sit down and listen to this thing all the way through don&amp;#39;t expect to be pleased as punch with this album the first go around I could definitely understand this LP getting criticized as being maybe long- winded kind of pretentious maybe a little depressing too but honestly that doesn&amp;#39;t change the fact that I love this thing and it&amp;#39;s not like it&amp;#39;s the most indulgent thing in the world it&amp;#39;s not like listening to Trout mask replica all right so what&amp;#39;s actually on here song wise if you take a listen to this thing it&amp;#39;s going to kind of be like partaking in an auditory experiment where all the musicians involved tried to use sound to paint an accurate picture of the beginning and the end of the world these songs feature really exciting highs and and tear-jerking interludes and really kind of dark angry sad sad sad Lowe&amp;#39;s thankfully it starts off on a positive note with the title track or sort of title movement which I have been able to kind of follow along with on this map of the album that comes with the album itself although it is not that accurate of a map being that some songs and movements end before or after they actually say they do over here that&amp;#39;s whatever because this first six minutes or so of this LP is some of the most breathtaking beautiful and amazingly layered rock music to ever fall under the genre of post Rock just tons of strings shimmering guitars swelling horns these really marching drums and all these instruments just escalate and escalate and escalate layering and building is really where these guys have a fine tuned strength that is often imitated but not often recreated these guys really value and understand tension as if they&amp;#39;re related to it or something the Builds on this thing are pretty slow don&amp;#39;t expect them to go anywhere fast I mean these songs do go past 20 minutes sometimes but in my opinion godspeed really knows how to keep the quieter sides of their builds pretty listenable and engaging with interesting sounds lots of dynamic playing but when it comes to the louder sides of these builds godspeed really knows how to prove how cohesive of a group they are and how just detail oriented these songs are because they&amp;#39;re always just getting louder and more intense just as you think these guys have reached the final Apex of a build they manag to figure out a way to just get a shade darker or a shade brighter the size of the sounds that godspeed plays with over the course of a build evolve of course but also sometimes the phrases of the strings or just the horn arrangements or the guitar leads will change over the course of a build as well upwards or downwards which is also really nice because it adds to the evolution of the song You&amp;#39;re not hearing this one single phrase performed in the one single way you did at the beginning of the song at the end of the song which is awesome because some groups will kind of slouch when it comes to adding extra instruments into their songs because it&amp;#39;s an extra instrument it&amp;#39;s just kind of there to add another color another texture the strings the posos and the horns as well there&amp;#39;s some Glock and Spiel on this LP to all those play really pivotal roles on this album from movement to movement to movement kind of a different instrument a different sound takes the spotlight which brings lift your skinny fists some awesome variety as soon as godspeed reaches a lot of the tops the tip tip tops of these builds that I&amp;#39;ve been talking about sometimes and and it&amp;#39;s a little formulaic they will kind of cut its throat and just let it die really quickly and kind of transition or segue into something different but you know to their credit they always transition into something interesting or just seems like a really fluid on this LP like this first movement that I&amp;#39;ve been talking about as soon as it reaches its end it just explodes wildly and these kind of wailing strings are left over in the background it kind of explodes like a firework and the strings left over screaming are kind of like the the the fading and flickering Smither left in the air as it falls to the Earth those strings kind of develop into a drone and then this guitar very delicately played introduces itself playing the melody to what seems like Amazing Grace it&amp;#39;s almost a cover of Amazing Grace actually which eventually builds itself up to be one of the most heavy and riveting versions of the song I&amp;#39;ve ever heard all of a sudden godspeed just kind of breaks away with these dissonant strings kind of interrupting that song and they just take a turn for something much darker which makes this album feel even more like a movie for me it&amp;#39;s like something in the storyline had just changed Like a Villain had just been introduced a villain something evil something bad because this part of the song sounds like fists clenching and teeth nashing and Bricks going through storefront windows after that track slows down the album goes into to a pretty hefty series of of ambient interludes and soundscapes and and collage music and every moment just feels really kind of vast and eerie and haunting and just just like endless in terms of just its reach its largess these guys make quiet music that just seems as huge as when they&amp;#39;re being loud it&amp;#39;s really something that the Tim Hecker fan in me totally gets off on in this series of ambient interludes the most striking moment for me is when this low-voiced pitch shifted woman&amp;#39;s voice starts speaking and it seems like she is giving a sermon the woman is talking about God and like I said her voice is kind of slowed down for this weird effect there weeping strings in there and she&amp;#39;s talking about dying and seeing God seeing God in some kind of vision and and going insane the woman seems to be really passionate and really kind of sure about what she&amp;#39;s saying toward the end of this clip that godspeed plays she even goes as far as to say she knows things she can say things she has words that that aren&amp;#39;t even in your Bibles yet but the thing is even though this woman seems kind of excited about the stuff she&amp;#39;s saying the way godspeed has altered her voice and the music they&amp;#39;re playing against what she&amp;#39;s saying makes it seem very kind of dark and and twisted and disturbing too that one part of the album is something that I just cannot get out of my head the way those strings sound the way that woman&amp;#39;s voice sounds it&amp;#39;s all very unsettling for me following that movement the band pulls out another kind of slow buing rock tune that to me is is one of the most Twisted moments on the album the guitars on this one really whale the strings kind kind of circle around where the guitars are playing in a very repetitive way to to kind of make this spiraling effect and this little tiny baby glock and Spiel is just swallowed in the insanity there&amp;#39;s a lot of material that comes after this track including one of the band&amp;#39;s most popular songs which starts off with a little monologue a little snippet from a conversation with a New Yorker talking about Coney Island how it was the playground of the world how people us used to sleep on the beach there and now things have changed even though this is a great track I think pretty much all the material on this album is great it would be impossible for me to go over every single song moment segue transition interlude all of it plus I feel like in a way I&amp;#39;d be spoiling the album a little bit because like I said this is one of the most movie likee experiences I&amp;#39;ve ever had with an album there are different movements and climaxes on here and each one of them brings a different set of ideas and emotions to me this album to me is is equal parts uplifting and unsettling there are plenty of beautiful moments here but there are also spots on here that are as forlorn as a funeral March except this album has been created with with such a far-reaching ambition it&amp;#39;s almost like godspeed You black Emperor is trying to play off the entire planet like goodbye Earth you had a good run now you&amp;#39;re burnt to a crisp because of the military industrial complex people are dead buildings are Rubble streets are cracked the skies are black that&amp;#39;s basically the attitude you&amp;#39;ll be running into a little bit with this album not really an attitude I&amp;#39;m sure a lot of you subscribe to I don&amp;#39;t subscribe to it I don&amp;#39;t think the world is that terrible of a place and maybe godspeed doesn&amp;#39;t either if the world were that bad why make make music for it but I personally don&amp;#39;t have a problem with staring at the world&amp;#39;s flaws and listening to music inspired by them to put it simply lift your skinny fists is an album loaded with qualities that I look for in music lots of ambition great recording and sound memorable textures Melodies and songs some experimentation on here as well lots of variety in terms of ideas and and different genres of music great playing and performance from these guys which really enhances the more ferocious moments on here and the more fragile ones too interesting use of samples and sounds and and voices too strong themes and concept and an interesting use of samples and and and voices and as kind of an added bonus it&amp;#39;s all kind of tied together into these really cohesive orchestral movements that that segue into each other really well using drones and ambient soundscapes and interludes there is definitely a formula going on here even if it isn&amp;#39;t completely apparent because there is so much material to take in on this album but still there are enough variations on this style that godspeed has with this record that I&amp;#39;m never really bored I&amp;#39;m never really fed up I&amp;#39;m never really tired of what&amp;#39;s going on here this album is just like a roller coaster for me it brings up so many tions within me I know there are a lot of Records out there where people will kind of attach them to certain points in their life like oh I listened to this record in the in the summer of 08 I mean I know I do that personally but this record despite how long I&amp;#39;ve been listening to this thing for years and years and years I&amp;#39;ve never really done that all that happens when I listen to this record is I just kind of see imagery in my head of just apocalypse and just like righteousness and Skyline and War and people and nature and it seems as I listen to this album more over the years that imagery just gets stronger and stronger and stronger in my head not only do I find this album to be incredibly beautiful but a really unique experience to me and enlightening experience personally anyway and that&amp;#39;s pretty much my take on this thing cuch chesta hey everybody calra Chester here to say the great gats For You black Emperor great band you should listen hope you had a good holiday [Music] forever"

    "date": "August 6, 2021",
    "genre": "Neoclassical Darkwave",
    "transcript": "um yeah yeah here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of the new lingua ignota record sinner get ready this is a new album from singer writer and composer uh miss kristen hater aka lingua ignota her third album to date following the immense caligula in 2019 one of the greatest and easily most shocking records of that year which saw hater delving into themes of abuse and betrayal against horrifying combinations of noise classical music and dark wave with a somewhat metal twist so i&amp;#39;m still really enamored with this record but i don&amp;#39;t know if my pitiful little soul could take another helping of lingua ignota music in such a short amount of time i guess you could say this sinner was not ready christianity and music of worship has played a significant role in lingua ignota&amp;#39;s music since the release of all  die and it&amp;#39;s something i picked up on pretty quickly as a recovering catholic and i get a sense from her music and from her interviews that she is as well to a degree but despite that i greatly appreciate the way she&amp;#39;s been able to balance these feelings of faith and awe with the destruction and fanaticism that often paints christianity&amp;#39;s past now on past lingua ignota efforts these religious themes and aesthetics have been there they&amp;#39;ve been present they have been very present but maybe not the main focus but on center get ready they take up so much more of the center stage this new lp comes with a slight change in musical aesthetics too the classical instrumentation and vocal pageantry are still here in spades but this time hater is working in more elements of folk and neofolk even the closing track seems like her own powerful and dirty take on a church hymn there are quite a few vocal snippets and recordings in reference to christianity or at least parts of it strewn about the record too on the closing track we get a woman talking to a cnn reporter about how she can&amp;#39;t get sick from covid because she&amp;#39;s covered in jesus&amp;#39;s blood there&amp;#39;s a man recalling a hymn that his mother used to sing televangelist and all-around garbage person jimmy swaggart apologizing for cheating in front of his congregation and not to insinuate this record is like some sort of christian hate hour it&amp;#39;s not because there are moments of genuine beauty and i think spiritual transcendence throughout this record too but there&amp;#39;s a duality to center get ready and i think a lot of that push and pull centers around haters macabre attraction to christianity throughout this album you have feelings of extreme devotion and faith mixed with feelings of disgust and distress and the opening track displays the love but also the madness that can come from these extremes given dramatically sung lines like sickness finds a way in maybe even the ways in which organized religion can be perverted the music on this particular track reflects that dichotomy too as the first leg of it is a little brooding but by lingua ignota standards it&amp;#39;s pretty bright and uplifting one of the more euphoric passages of the record with soaring vocal harmonies and rich piano chords a wall of instrumentation that&amp;#39;s building as high as the tallest reaches of a chapel ceiling it&amp;#39;s incredible it&amp;#39;s an amazing sound but eventually this all comes crashing down with these chaotic slamming dissonant piano chords and booming hits of bass plus lots of tragic opera style singing from hater as well it&amp;#39;s a long but gratifying tone setter for the record that i think lets listeners know what exactly they&amp;#39;re going to be in for like if you&amp;#39;re not vibing with this you might want to turn back now so yes the start of the record is incredibly chilling and i find this to be even more so the case for i who bend the tall grasses this track is mostly centered around a very somber organ cord cycle that sets the stage for a vocal performance from hater that not only calls on her singing chops but her acting chops too as she&amp;#39;s playing out a scene that&amp;#39;s similar to a lot of bible tales out there where you have a protagonist that is begging god for something they are going through pain or sacrifice to prove their worth or their devotion i have made my body your vessel i preach your word in every room i have walked the earth weeping i have whipped my back with my sorrows are my sacrifices not extravagant she&amp;#39;s doing anything to fulfill this spiritual relationship that in a way is thankless or it&amp;#39;s one way and she&amp;#39;s being driven to the brink because of it now uh the ask that she&amp;#39;s seeking for from god on this track is to intercede and uh kill someone and when asking for that she kind of switches back and forth between uh speaking with language that&amp;#39;s in a more biblical voice or uh just straight saying like i don&amp;#39;t give a i&amp;#39;m not asking ah but in this one scenario in this one portion of the record there is just like so much to dig out of the narrative and the language considering like the toxicity and the violence and obviously the negative uh relationship and association she has with the person who she wants to die but then also the ways in which this is kind of mirrored and displayed in this weird relationship with god that is uh being described inadvertently through the dialogue and through the ask and the desperation to get something in return for the sacrifice and the devotion the unsettling vibes turn more drony chaotic and acoustic on the following many hands which feels like a twisted interpretation on a religious folk song of some sort with lots of repetitious lyrics building vocal layers the instrumentation sounds pretty organic but i love how the more cluttered and i guess chaotic it gets the more distorted it feels and sounds and even though in comparison this track may not be as dramatic as the previous one i find the lyrics to be just as horrifying with a sinner being told to get ready for the unforgiving arrival of god and what happens after that arrival is not pretty the following pennsylvania furnace i thought was a kind of mild teaser for this record but believe me after the first three songs this relative breather is very much needed there are some gorgeous instrumental builds and resolutions on the back end of the track but if you were expecting the lyrics on this one to brighten up not not gonna happen if you&amp;#39;ve consumed any of haters music to a fair amount up until this point and paid attention paid attention to the details you&amp;#39;ve probably noticed like loneliness and solitude are a recurring theme and that&amp;#39;s what this song centers around seems we&amp;#39;re dealing with a protagonist here who has kind of accepted the fact that they are going to be alone and they&amp;#39;re wishing to i guess die with their dog and end their life as a result of that me and the dog die together do you want to live in hell with me i&amp;#39;ve watched you alone in the home where you live with your family and all that i&amp;#39;ve learned is everything burns that being said i urge anyone listening to this track to not take it as a literal statement of intent or anything like that i see it more as a hater telling a story of isolation and loneliness and then from the outside kind of identifying with those feelings that are occurring within the story now for any big fans of a catholicism out there you may know that repenting and confessing is a big part of that and hey that&amp;#39;s what the next song is all about in fact it&amp;#39;s maybe the most harrowing and ghoulish appalachia folk inspired song about it ever and what god will do to you if you don&amp;#39;t confess remember this body is not your home because you know it&amp;#39;s just like a a vessel that you&amp;#39;re existing in until you transcend to the kingdom of heaven obviously uh oh he will knock the breath from you he will ram your eyes with glass he will take your legs and your will to live if you do not confess now which of course all builds up the pageantry of the record that i was referring to earlier but it doesn&amp;#39;t make listening to this any less frightening especially given some of the dark and sinister harmonies uh strewn about this kind of droney track haters uh vocals on this one the vocal layers are absolutely nuts i feel like i&amp;#39;m trapped in the american version of midsummer located uh in like a rural mountain area in west virginia now the sacred liniment of judgment oddly enough is another relatively bright spot on the lp there&amp;#39;s something kind of blissful about hater&amp;#39;s voice and the droning folk instrumentation on this one i&amp;#39;d also like to note the repetition of this track and much of the album itself overall which i think also ties so deeply into the influences coming from religious music in general on this record as music of worship does tend to lean into repetition as a means of evoking this otherworldly madness in its listeners it&amp;#39;s repetition past the point of the music feeling like a piece or you&amp;#39;re progressing through a composition it&amp;#39;s repetition to the point where whatever you&amp;#39;re listening to feels more like a sensation or a presence and there can be an incredible intensity to that which i think is effectively plugged into this record very well also the eerie use of the jimmy swagger sample on this cut ties pretty deeply into experimental rock bands like swans or various neofolk and post rock outfits i think this clip also speaks pretty greatly to the themes of infidelity and betrayal lace throughout this record which also calls back to earlier lingua ignota work the perpetual flame of centralia is another gorgeous moment in the track list here sonically and instrumentally a refuge of sorts in the way that pennsylvania furnace was but lyrically it&amp;#39;s kind of a refuge too featuring hater singing about being on a righteous path and knowing no fear because she has faith in god faith in jesus overall it&amp;#39;s a super simple track with mostly just vocals and pianos some subtle instrumental flourishes in the second half it&amp;#39;s just gorgeous from front to back very soft very easy going but also with reference to the fires of hell burning dull and long which is a clever callback to the title of this song which is in reference to a town in pennsylvania that i guess has had an underground mine fire burning since the 60s and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s still going to this day it&amp;#39;s still going right now they just kind of like abandoned the town entirely at one point and raised it to the ground in the 90s and 2000s and just as a side note i love the various ways in which the pennsylvania area is kind of inspiring certain songs and lyrics throughout this record man is like a spring flowers a moment on the record that i am slightly emotionally mixed on but still so deeply in love with the opening features haters singing with these really campy sour vocal harmonies i feel like these vocal passages are a necessary tension build up to this really gratifying beautiful minimalist classical passage that comes immediately after sounds like a han zimmer piece or some with the way everything&amp;#39;s like layering up and building the vocal leads and layers that hater lays into this section of the track are incredible and gorgeous and awe inspiring as she is describing the heart of man as being impossible to hold with love not being enough to do that with one person not being enough to do that keep in mind this track also features audio from a sex worker that jimmy swaggart used to meet up with which he got caught with that person and that&amp;#39;s why he was apologizing in the first place in the earlier clip played on the record but yes this track is gorgeous it&amp;#39;s cathartic it&amp;#39;s tense and also tragic all at once as this song feels almost like the final nail in the coffin when it comes to these themes of infidelity and betrayal in the lingua ignota canon this feels like a final statement on this and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like it it is what it is this is the heart of man and in terms of you know my interpretation of it this is my feelings on it we then arrive at the hymns style closing track that i mentioned earlier which is gorgeous and relatively another moment of solace on the album as hater describes a paradise being hers reaching some point of closure i like narratively what this track means for the record but the selling point for me is really just the incredible gorgeous and harmonious vocal layers and horns throughout this track as well i love the melody of it too it kind of reminds me of one of my favorite hymns of all time abide with me but yeah this track is just wonderful it&amp;#39;s gorgeously arranged i honestly find myself just playing this one single song over and over and over just because of how euphoric the whole thing feels but yeah a lot of this record is is about religion and deals deeply in religious themes but honestly when you kind of dig beyond that uh a lot of this is brought up to express emotions and feelings on a lot of the same deeper issues that were wrestled with on caligula again the betrayal the infidelity the abuse and a host of other things which mind you is not a complaint i actually like that hater was able to engage with these ideas once again from another angle creatively and do it in a way that narrative wise feels way more cohesive and consistent and as a result of that it comes across as more thorough but yeah i&amp;#39;m really just like massively impressed and in awe of this record in a multitude of ways the production the songwriting the performances are all incredible and the way they come together as a whole is something to behold as well in a weird way i felt like this record was a religious experience in and of itself and like a religious experience uh despite the fact that i&amp;#39;ve been talking all this time i have a difficult time summing it up and putting the whole thing into words and maybe the easiest way to do that is to describe not what it is but how it makes me feel or what i feel about it and that&amp;#39;s that i think it&amp;#39;s beautiful it&amp;#39;s awe-inspiring but it&amp;#39;s also scary it reminds me of my size my weaknesses because i feel like i&amp;#39;m dealing with and listening to something that&amp;#39;s much bigger than me which i think will be the takeaway for a lot of people who choose to listen to this album and wrestle with it on its own terms but yeah i&amp;#39;m at a loss for anything else to say i feel like i just have to give this a 10 yeah i&amp;#39;m just really like devastated and just left with nothing else to do i&amp;#39;m cornered i&amp;#39;m cornered here and it&amp;#39;s just like ah it&amp;#39;s so yeah there you go aha tran position have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you

    "transcript": "hi everyone synthony note tano here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd i hope you&amp;#39;re doing well and it is time for a review of the new spelling album the turning wheel spelling with three l&amp;#39;s is back with a brand new full-length lp if you were unaware spelling is the musical pseudonym of songwriter singer multi-instrumentalist and composer christia cabral she is now on her third full-length lp which takes us even deeper into her mystical strange and constantly developing world something we caught a glimpse of on her sacred bones debut in 2019 mazie fly a bewitching art pop album with minimal synth passages ethereal production as well as psychedelic undertones not the most consistent album under the sun but a curious one nonetheless one that had me looking forward to whatever cabral&amp;#39;s next move would be but as good as maisyfly was for the most part i can&amp;#39;t say i saw the turning wheel coming like not only is this project such a stylistic departure from maisyfly but man it&amp;#39;s so grand in presentation it&amp;#39;s one of those rare instances where you get to hear an artist like really pushing themselves and going above and beyond and sounding great doing it whether we&amp;#39;re talking about the progy anthemic guitar solos coalescing with analog synthesizers and bright horn sections on boys at school or the dramatic and classically tinged soul of little deer the harp the hand drums the strings on this track like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s one of the most stunning presentations of sound on any opening track this year a great deal of this lp is just so far removed from the ghostly haunting soundscapes of maisiefly to the point where spelling on this album anyway has just evolved into something so much more material more colorful progressive pop with an extremely artsy and fantastical edge reference points such as kate bush do come to mind i mean how could they not with the classical influences the pop influences and the vocal style but you know what so does 60s baroque pop as well as stevie wonder considering all the ornate vibrant and frankly sometimes fun instrumental excursions this project goes on like the disco beat switch up in the last leg of revolution which comes along with some crowd commotion too progressive electronic music pours in as a major influence on multiple tracks in the second half especially on queen of wands which is one of the least lyrically driven songs on the project as it mostly becomes what feels like this gigantic john carpenter-esque horrifying synth odyssey topped with some vocals that feel like i&amp;#39;m hearing joanna newsom run through scott walker style vibratos which is about as insane a combination of sounds that you could think of but what i think makes even more sense in terms of explaining this album is maybe see the track list as a series of musical monologues sung by the most nature infatuated disney princess ever because above any similarity this record has to anything else the music on the turning wheel is whimsical it&amp;#39;s enchanting it&amp;#39;s sometimes chilling it is an immersive listen too because in many ways this album feels like an exercise in world building i don&amp;#39;t think cabral wants people walking away from this lp just feeling like it&amp;#39;s a mere collection of tracks but rather an experience that is transportative the future for example feels like a song as much as it feels like a destination as we hear swells of background vocals and woodwinds underneath cabral&amp;#39;s choruses of i live in the future the future the irony of the writing here being that this song is very much about feeling out of place in the present having to wait for your ideas to take hold or get popular in order to feel at home in the world you&amp;#39;ve been born into and sometimes it&amp;#39;s clear the music is doing a lot of heavy lifting in terms of trying to paint a picture as well case in point emperor with an egg where lyrically cabral seems to be describing an emperor penguin protecting its egg from the cold she sings describing him saying that he can swim with his wings like an arrow like this immediately after saying that the instrumental breaks into this densely layered series of string passages backed up with throbbing synthesizers it&amp;#39;s a great mental and auditory image that&amp;#39;s being conveyed here the track also leaves off on a bit of a creepy cliffhanger with the mention of a sea lion kind of painting that as a threat to the penguin the track is primarily about which maybe to some is an odd story to throw in the midst of this lp but when you look at the lyrics on this record at large it&amp;#39;s not really because so many parts of this album seem to concern themselves with the natural world whether that is literally or merely by reference a good deal of this record is also about feeling at odds with a society that stands against that natural world there are quite a few lyrics that mention decomposition as like a mode of going back to that world as well whether it be on little deer where cabral sings tender lovers of the earth turn us back into the dirt or on the track a magic act where we have take my body make my brain a garden as a mantra being repeated on that track there are also some strong feelings of isolation expressed on the track boys at school revolution is an interesting point on the record as well as it deals pretty heavily in feeling like you&amp;#39;re getting older always changing never settling always burning never finishing never completing narratively and instrumentally this track feels like the true closer of the record while sweet talk is almost like the epilogue of the whole thing which reads like a strange and beautiful ode to music itself almost like it&amp;#39;s trying to be a smart little afterthought to the listener to remind them uh ultimately even though this record is very much about the world very much about the self ultimately it&amp;#39;s this love and passion of music that is driving all of it and no doubt spelling is about her music not only because of all of the genres and styles and influences involved in this lp but also all the musicians between all the players arrangers and engineers who seem like they&amp;#39;re pretty carefully listed out on the bandcamp page for this album like how many people are involved in this record like dozens i don&amp;#39;t know if the budget for this lp was through the roof or if cabral is just really great at networking uh even during a pandemic maybe it&amp;#39;s a little bit of column a and b either way it&amp;#39;s an incredible feat for one person to be overseeing all of this never mind the fact that it is uh produced immaculately i mean you guys watch the reviews you know that i am absolutely obsessed with uh all things production often it&amp;#39;s the easiest thing for me to nitpick on in any review and i&amp;#39;ve gone over this record again and again and again with excitement but very very many times and from the subtle addition of hand drums on little deer to the even subtler edition of a low droning sub bass note on sweet talk right at the finish there is not an eq a mix or an instrumental layer on this thing i take issue with from the harps to the brass to the bases and woodwinds and variety of synths used throughout this record each piece seems to play a clear and effective role in this ecosystem of sound and i love that these tracks unfold so beautifully no matter what shape they take whether you&amp;#39;re talking about the rich and extravagant title track that has this lovely series of chorus vocal layers with a marching baroque instrumental break there&amp;#39;s the groovy 80s tinged art pop on always which is just loaded with lovesick lyrics the heavier and more progressive linear tracks are killer as well like magic act which finishes things off with these soaring eerie and strange guitar solo bits that just cry out over distant drums and despondent synth layers from bops to ballads to anthems and curious meditations the turning wheel is spinning multiple plates at once doing it flawlessly and seamlessly too as for track after track cabral&amp;#39;s distinct personality coming through her voice her poetry and her compositions just brings all these tracks together the closest thing to an outlier on this record to my ears again is sweet talk which i mentioned already is like a post-closing statement anyway oh and the songwriting is so good it&amp;#39;s so well structured and paced it keeps boys at school engaging and mesmerizing for its full seven minute run it even makes the track awaken endearing which like sounds the most like musical theater on this entire lp which is a sound i&amp;#39;m not usually keen on but damn the close vocal harmonies on this track are gorgeous the tubular bell melodies are epic as well as the uh bold calls of america i&amp;#39;m consistently impressed with this record on the lyrical side as well as cabral centers around a very tightly knit series of of themes that she doesn&amp;#39;t stale out and as a result i think this album paints a wondrous portrait of her character and point of view delivering it through a lens of flawless sonic fantasy the biggest warning i think i could give you is that at first this album may sound a little longer than it actually is which once you get to really enjoying it is not really an issue considering the second half of this thing is profoundly darker than the first it may take a couple more listens to get acclimated to that cabral&amp;#39;s voice also may not be for everybody but listen if you can&amp;#39;t appreciate her singing on this album there&amp;#39;s a lot out there in the music world that you&amp;#39;re just not ready for the vocals across this lp are so gorgeous they&amp;#39;re expressive they&amp;#39;re wonderful showcasing even more range than cabral let on with maziefly and not only does she sing well on this record but seemingly with no fear too considering some of her odd yelpy embellishments the wild vibrato she uses as well as just like her lack of hesitance in just digging into the depths of her vocal range too look i can&amp;#39;t say enough positive things about this album i think it&amp;#39;s stunning and beautiful and moving and uh just great from start to finish not only do i have a little to no issue with it but i&amp;#39;m blown away by it i&amp;#39;m blown away by it i&amp;#39;m mega impressed with it in so many ways i think this record is the artistic equivalent of reaching for the stars and then just creating supernovas squeezing them in your palms and crushing them i&amp;#39;m unequivocally feeling a 10 on uh this album tran position have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don&amp;#39;t cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head it&amp;#39;s another video you

    "transcript": "hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet&amp;#39;s busy yes to be a second &amp;#39;red and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of the new daughters record you won&amp;#39;t get what you want this is the new comeback album from Providence Rhode Island band daughters who we haven&amp;#39;t heard from as far as studio albums go for like almost a decade not since the band&amp;#39;s 2010 self-titled record which at the time was supposed to be their swan song which was a big change of pace from a lot of the noise and mathcore the band had been dabbling in for the first half of the aughts even though I don&amp;#39;t find daughter&amp;#39;s first two albums to be incredibly interesting what was supposed to be their final album over here was easily one of the heaviest and most refreshing noise rock albums to come out in a long time and not just because of the fad pummeling riffs and percussion and the tight performances to but also the bright shrill sour insane guitar tones all over this thing which to this day still sound crazy it&amp;#39;s like it puts my brain on fire my brain is on fire I got fire brain so considering where we left off with daughters I was pretty excited to hear this new album I was also pretty impressed with teaser tracks like Satan and the wait which showed the band going in a darker subtler direction it also showed the band stringing their songwriting out to 7 minutes which for daughters is kind of crazy their debut full-length album is 11 minutes in length it&amp;#39;s an album with numerous songs on it and it&amp;#39;s 11 minutes this whole new record is an undertaking in length for daughters it&amp;#39;s approximately 50 minutes which is almost twice as long as their last album given that the new sonic territory the more ambitious song structures I was pretty excited to hear what this album held for the band and I&amp;#39;m happy to say this album was not only worth the wait but it&amp;#39;s also far better than its predecessor holy crap holy crap holy crap holy crap holy crap holy crap what is this I thought this record was going to be dark and abrasive and strange for sure without a doubt but I had black hole I will be tumbling down on us and torturing demented sounds they&amp;#39;re subject to the violence plays auditory abuse this thing is like all the cacophony of the last record but with more body more atmosphere more versatility more influences not just noise rock but industrial rock and no wave and art punk it feels like I&amp;#39;m listening to the [ __ ] explosive brand of rock music that used to permeate the underground in the 2000s thanks to bands like daughters but then it got tossed away into a sewer drain left to ferment and mutate for eight years and now it&amp;#39;s grown into a 30-story monster come back to destroy everything in its path the whole thing starts off with the track city song which feels like a heavy industrialized take on a suicide track or maybe even something throbbing gristle would have done back in the day with these rollin throbbing overblown hits of percussion which are super distorted clipping that&amp;#39;s paired with some warping rough synth notes some deadpan poetry and these three simple elements by themselves create such a creepy atmosphere already so early on the record the band has set an utterly disturbing tone I love how weird and off-putting and flat the vocals are it&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re kind of difficult to read they feel so soulless and so aloof I love the way the band builds up the momentum with extra percussion the additional eerie ringing tones and then we get a breakdown of near silence before the band explodes back into this final ugly crescendo it&amp;#39;s like this nuclear bomb of cathartic hideousness the guitar tones at this point in the tracker so freakish and deafening and maddening they make me want to slam my head through a wall it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m being slowly smothered to death this track transitions very quickly after the long road no turns which is an absolutely harrowing song features these twanging nightmare funhouse circus organ type guitars skipping over these marching tom drums again just a few seconds in and it already sounds like one of the most messed up things I&amp;#39;ve heard in 2018 and the band only goes on to make this song sound even more deranged as it progresses especially with lyrics like everybody climbs a pie that falls real far a little is all takes a little is all it takes I don&amp;#39;t know what to say when people come apart the road is long the road is dark the track to me just reads like this internal monologue of snapping becoming unhinged being on the verge of a mental break and the song really builds up some mean tension with the driving bass the crashing drums the guitar freak outs also loving the multiple phases of this song to the direct delivery it has me on the edge of my seat but I&amp;#39;m not sitting on it I&amp;#39;m standing on it and there&amp;#39;s a noose on my neck the track Satan in the weight kicks off like one might expect it to given the two previous tracks with spaced out Tom drums and grime cake bass and these guitars that are just melting in the mix then we get lyrics like that bastard had a head like matchstick a face like you&amp;#39;d been sucking concrete through a straw some faces not even a mother can love says the spit and spatter of broken glass from above it&amp;#39;s one of many moments on the album where we get the grim and fevered delivery of a Nick Cave but also the poetic license of a Tom Waits eventually this track kind of loses its edgy demeanor and actually blossoms into some legitimately beautiful guitar lines that have a nice sparkly Sheen to them at this point the track becomes super atmospheric almost like something out of The Twilight Zone and given the track&amp;#39;s mantra of this world is opening up it feels like I&amp;#39;m slowly being sucked into something the song known as the flammable man is a blistering labyrinth of busy guitars and drums outside of a few momentary breathers on this cut it is absolutely relentless and even though you could say this is one of the more straightforward cuts of the bunch maybe not quite as experimental as the other songs on here the band does work in a really nice and interesting stuttering wall of noise in the last leg there&amp;#39;s not a single song on here where daughters completely forgoes the sound play it&amp;#39;s always consistent it&amp;#39;s present it&amp;#39;s on point we are left off again with another haunting mantra on this track is something burning here or is it me the Lord&amp;#39;s song is a horrifying no wave rager with whipping twisted guitars it sounds like something out of a battle song but from hell meanwhile the Glacial walls of dissonance we get another point in the song sound like something out of the most sickening murder scene in movie history the song less sex is a much needed cooldown point on this album it&amp;#39;s almost Trent Reznor ish with it&amp;#39;s very deadpan intimate lead vocals it&amp;#39;s synthetic drums its industrial atmosphere there&amp;#39;s a little bass groove in there some sinister walls of noise various points of the cut also the forlorn vocal leads with the structure of the track - it almost reads like kind of a blues song maybe even something some zeal and ardour fans would appreciate not to mention some fetus or maybe a little this heat either way they&amp;#39;re really sharp ringing guitar tones that plays throughout many points of this album on this particular track they actually gain a very beautiful dark sense of harmony not nearly as off-putting or as horrifying as they sound on many other cuts here it&amp;#39;s actually gorgeous the song daughter carries a lot of the mellow energy of the previous track with a very simple bass groove and a drum beat that sounds almost bossa nova&amp;#39; ish but darkened up a little bit given all the material up to this point on the album I think the first leg of this track aside from the swarm of detuned guitar tones is a little unsuspecting but then the band breaks loose in the second half into these glorious glamorous gothic harmonies that are fantastic it makes me want to wear black for the rest of my life the song the reason they hate me is maybe the most straightforward rock tune on the entire record not only in terms of groove but it&amp;#39;s verse-chorus verse-chorus instrumental bridge refrain on the outro it is one of the catchiest and most direct moments on the entire album with its driving bass and the manic rants coming out of the vocals also the guitars on this thing sound like the dissonant shots of strings from the psycho soundtrack but on steroids especially on the hook where they literally go dick dick dick dick dick dick dick dick dick it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m being stabbed but with a sound ocean song offers a change of pace in that it is a story song hinged upon the dejected shouting of frontman Alexis Marshall the track lyrically is a surreal description of a man coming home and being overcome by some great terror he is hit with this desire to run just run as fast as he can away from his house I guess away from his life the lyricism is fantastic I would even say literary his shoes come off his feet and shadow him for several yards ghosts of why he was desperate to keep up until gone now the road punching upward into his sock naked feet the band hits the listener with yet another 20 story tall wall of sour guitars which yet it&amp;#39;s obviously happened a lot of times up until this point on the album but this is one of the nastiest examples of it so far it actually reaches kind of a deafening fever pitch with some really tense drum fills and some acoustic guitar worked in there too it really does kind of give you the feeling of of being chased this song kind of turned on my fight or flight reflexes the track eventually coasts out on this meditative repetition of these riffs and drums it&amp;#39;s almost little swans ish it&amp;#39;s a very powerful ending but believe it or not the band actually saves the best for last with the song guesthouse which at this point for me on this record I&amp;#39;m feeling crazy because I&amp;#39;m playing a numbers game in my head and I&amp;#39;m thinking everything up until this point has been so watertight what are the chances this band is just gonna stick the landing here I don&amp;#39;t know what the chances were but I guess they were in daughter&amp;#39;s favor because this ending what do I even say about this ending I&amp;#39;m honestly out of words because I it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s so overpowering this track is one of the ugliest things I&amp;#39;ve ever heard the relentless guitars on this thing are terrifying and Marshall screams of the fear in agony in his voice on this track is palpable and then the madness of this song is given this grandiose presentation with what sounds like some really beautiful and rich horns and strings it&amp;#39;s like orchestral sighs I think maybe these additions might be synthetic in some way shape or form but either way they coast out beautifully especially when the guitars and drums kind of disintegrate to let that orchestral instrumentation just kind of bring this record to a close it&amp;#39;s like the calm after one of the most tumultuous musical storms I&amp;#39;ve been subjected to this decade and not just tumultuous because I&amp;#39;ve heard a number of very noisy chaotic albums this year in many years up until this point but this record is really visceral like you really get into it physically it&amp;#39;s not just this wall of noise that you just stand on the outside of and doesn&amp;#39;t really have any kind of emotional baggage to it this is a physical album and on top of that this record is so terrifying amazing finish super consistent but terrifying sound what a terrifying album what a terrifying album and like a lot of great horror movies I feel like this album almost comes to the conclusion that we are the monster the monster comes from within because all the horrible and scary things that are set in the lyrics on this record mostly seem to be rooted into this internal darkness that one can&amp;#39;t really shake this record is the horror of losing control and becoming that monster you work every day so hard not to be and I feel like your ability to deal with that and and tolerate such such ugly sounds is is going to be deeply connected to whether or not this album actually even appeals to you feeling a strong 9 to a 10 on this thing hell yes to this album hell yes transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should I review next

    "transcript": "Hi everyone! AHHHHHH AHHHHHH AHHHHHH here, the Internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of the new self-titled project from Kanye West and Kid Cudi, Kids See Ghosts. Thus far it has been a very busy summer for producer, songwriter, singer, rapper Y-you know who he is, Kanye West Releasing several mini albums within weeks of one another the first of which, while not under his own name did feature his influence and production from front to back. Of course I am talking about Pusha T&amp;#39;s Daytona, a 7 track album that just breached 20 minutes in length; all killer no filler. Then following that was Kanye West&amp;#39;s new album, &amp;quot;Ye&amp;quot; Also 7 tracks, also just over 20 minutes. Equally to the point, though, not as aggressive and finely tuned as Daytona &amp;quot;ye&amp;quot; was also noticeably less extravagant and wildly experimental than Kanye&amp;#39;s past several albums, too but to me this album still struck me as an incredibly unique and important moment for Ye in just how vulnerable and harrowing the material on this album is. To me this record felt like Kanye going through an ego withdrawal and showing the suicidal and self-destructive lows that fuel his god complex highs, which brings me to the third installment of Kanye related releases this summer Kids See Ghosts I had an inkling that this album wouldn&amp;#39;t sound too much unlike the Ghost Town track off of Ye&amp;#39;s latest album because it features Kid Cudi, &amp;quot;Kids See Ghosts&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Ghost Town&amp;quot;, and there&amp;#39;s also a song on this record titled, &amp;quot;Freeee (Ghost Town, Pt. 2)&amp;quot; so there&amp;#39;s clearly some kind of linkage going on here So, I kind of got to wondering will Kids See Ghosts be aesthetically similar to that Ghost Town track? Will we see a similar fusion of hip hop and guitar music, maybe even hip hop and rock not too much unlike Kid Cudi&amp;#39;s WZRD project, which, I don&amp;#39;t know, worries me because I didn&amp;#39;t like that album too much Also, I was so skeptical going into this thing because a lot of Kid Cudi solo material has been painfully mediocre since Man on the Moon 2 And even though I&amp;#39;ve enjoyed yays recent releases, he&amp;#39;s in such a state of volatility right now Who knows if he can keep this quality up also didn&amp;#39;t Kid Cudi and Kanye like have a bit of a rocky Friendship thing lately that could affect this project too. So I did have reasons to be skeptical going into this album, but This record is amazing. It&amp;#39;s just as brief as everything else Ye has touched so far this year at 23 minutes and 7 tracks, but it flows fantastically in its short run time feeling like a Full complete album to the point where kids see ghosts actually feels longer than it is It also sounds completely unlike anything. Kanye has dropped so far this year Really dropped ever and sure while as I predicted there are elements of hip hop and rock being fused on this thing There&amp;#39;s so much more there are experimental hip hop elements being worked into this thing clearly some Madlib worship here and there and the Grunginess and the brevity of some of these instrumentals and songs. There&amp;#39;s even a neo psychedelia edge on this album, too I catch whiffs of some Flaming Lips here and there some Yoshimi soft bulletin Embryonic and even the terror some shots of hard rock and pop and R&amp;amp;B and even grunge get worked into this thing, too occasionally on this record There are some flashes of classic Kanye but there are plenty of moments here too where he is as out there as ever especially with some of the eclectic sample choices one of which is a 1930s Christmas song another one being a Kurt Cobain sample typically on this thing Kanye comes off really manic wild out of control Cudi being really forlorn dejected. It&amp;#39;s sort of like they&amp;#39;re both taking the emotional and and mental problems that they are known for in their music putting out there in their music and sort of Forming them like Voltron together into this short But epic experimental hip-hop opus and in a huge contrast from Kanye&amp;#39;s Ye record the production on this thing the verses nearly everything is so meticulously Assembled like the rawness the lo-fi Production the the feeling of lightning in a bottle the feeling that things on the record were just kind of cobbled together That does not carry over on a kid see ghosts at all I definitely get the sense that the songs on this thing were worked on for a very long time The music and the emotions on this thing are on the edge in every way imaginable for me this thing was mind-blowing on impact and Instantaneously catchy - we have the opening track on here feel the love featuring Pusha T Push drops are really expressive and flashy intro verse over these very somber synth chords right after these Distorted vocal leads from Kid Cudi being echoed out into oblivion *I can still feeel the looove* It&amp;#39;s a really powerful refrain powerful mantra to kick the record off with not only that but Cuddy singing this loud this forcefully and also this on pitch Right at the start of the record is is a very good sign so far the song sounds pretty cool. Pretty low-key pretty trippy Strange surely. It&amp;#39;s a great vibe, but I just did not see coming right around the corner at the end of this verse Kanye busting in and kind of simultaneously locking in with these gunshot snares that are marching away into the end of the song and over these snares she&amp;#39;s going *Kra! Kra kra kra! Kra krrrra! Kra! Sounding like Mike Patton while the song builds up this sonic and rhythmic momentum the track suddenly melts into these dreary bass tones and guitar leads that Miraculously Kid Cudi&amp;#39;s vocal lead still fits on top of even though this track is really short we&amp;#39;ve gone through the number of compositional Transitions that you usually hear in a song double its length the song just ends in such a powerful place Thanks to the performance the production really Everything the color the volume the texture it&amp;#39;s all on high Fire is a much more low-key moment on the record the shortest song at 2 minutes and 20 seconds It shows Kanye and Cuddy doing their thing over these very gnarly and rough chunky and Twangy guitar samples some eerie woodwind leads to some psychedelic vocal samples and sound effects It doesn&amp;#39;t hit as high as sonic Peak as some of the other songs on here, but I do feel like lyrically these are important moments for Kanye and Cudi as it seems like they&amp;#39;re kind of Establishing the personality the vibe the brand of of this collaborative project I also think this track works really well as a depressive counterpoint to the intro cut There&amp;#39;s also a marching quality to the percussion on this track to the persistent snare drums and tambourines *ba! ba! ba! ba! ba!* Pair that with the guitar sample and Cuddy&amp;#39;s haunting humming Hanging in the back and the song essentially sounds to me like a pirate dirge but in the best way possible in the best way possible there&amp;#39;s also something about Kanye&amp;#39;s verse on this track that just reminds me of 2000s era Kanye. It&amp;#39;s kind of like he&amp;#39;s been resurrected But has a newer darker edge the song fourth dimension though struck me as the most Classic Kanye moment on the entire record this song features the kind of genius level beat production that reminds me of cuts like Jesus walks Kanye drops this hilariously explicit verse. Of course. It&amp;#39;s about sex. I love the line in this verse when she tells him He&amp;#39;s in the wrong hole and he says he&amp;#39;s lost that uh, definitely got to me But also I love how Kanye sort of portrays sex as like this psychedelic experience talking about it as if it&amp;#39;s like another dimension That I can definitely fuck with and the the line that he ends his verse with saying that if he goes to jail He won&amp;#39;t finish the sin and then the rest of the verses just silence Then Cuddy&amp;#39;s verse this dude has not sounded this cold-blooded since the 2000s and I just love the camaraderie that is coming through on this album between these guys Already before we&amp;#39;ve even hit the halfway point It&amp;#39;s like Kanye and Kid Cudi are bringing the best out of one another on this record Reminding one another of what each other&amp;#39;s strengths are because we know Kanye and Cudi are longtime Admirers of each other&amp;#39;s work have inspired one another&amp;#39;s work and it&amp;#39;s like together in closed quarters on this record They each want to do whatever it is that makes one artist hold the other in such a high regard Because Cudi singing on this thing is more on point than it&amp;#39;s been in years. Like he&amp;#39;s so on pitch It&amp;#39;s scary sometimes I think the shakiest vocal moment for him on this thing is some of the moaning at the start of the track reborn But it&amp;#39;s not even really that bad but back to fourth dimension Cudi&amp;#39;s bars on this thing are really Slick really trippy and I love the hilarious vocals snippet that sort of ends the song out talking about, you know Just have the music do this and that the other thing and then you know Just two and a half minutes, that&amp;#39;s enough for a record. The song free is One of my favorites on here. I mean almost every song on this thing is a favorite of mine It&amp;#39;s this crazy hard rock rap fusion. That&amp;#39;s just Kanye and Cuddy go absolutely insane on this thing The track is a fantastic extension of some of the themes off the track ghost town throwing out this idea of freedom again And again and again and not just simply social or political freedom really a existential freedom freedom from pain freedom from like mortality the song features these blaring samples have chopped up hard rock guitars It sounds like something out of a Led Zeppelin song A lot of the instrumental though is owed to a very generous sample from a UK Instrumental hip hop producer who goes by the name of mr chop But even knowing that what Cuddy Kanye and ty dolla sign to do on top of this beat is incredible their gargantuan godlike proclamations of I feel FREEEEEEEEE Every single time Kanye and cutting shout that line. I feel like I&amp;#39;m being thrown down into a kaleidoscopic wormhole where all these colors are swirling around my brain ty dolla sign brings these Amazing vocal harmonies like these super dense super thick how many vocals are multi-tracked on top of each other it sounds so AAAAAH Even though ty dolla sign isn&amp;#39;t delivering as extrema vocal performance as Kanye or Cuddy He sounds rock and roll as fuck. Again, Kanye sounds absolutely manic on this track. Kid Cudi less So but there&amp;#39;s a bit of sass to some of what he delivers on the track Guess what babe? This song is not simply just a fantastic song by itself. It&amp;#39;s also redemption for me, too Like it&amp;#39;s a fantastic follow-up to ghost town it also sounds like what wizard should have been and the the the godlike vibe of this track the supernatural vibe of this track feels like something yeezus should have achieved reborn is an amazing and for Lauren cooled down after this cut Cudi singing truly makes the track and I love the songs lyrical themes of Moving forward and having no stress getting a clean slate beginning anew the need to hit the reset button once again Kanye drops a fantastic verse on this cut That is one of his most personal yet kind of echoing this very sentiment the haunting background vocals and cue piano and dusty beat may not sound like much just Listing them out But they do a whole lot with very little the refrain Cuddy ends with on this track too - I think adds a very powerful Sentiment to the song questioning which way should he go after either? Fucking up or going through this reborn process where maybe he&amp;#39;s bound to make the same mistakes again Then there is the incredibly chilling title track which features the most Meditative instrumental on the entire record more supernatural vibes coming off of this track a really eerie synth lead. A spectral chord progression. Yes. Yngwie aka mos def Also featuring on this thing on the back end in a very wise and in Sage like short verse Kanye&amp;#39;s verse is so great on this thing he comes through with so much authority and the finishing Cuddy montage just ends things off with Fireworks the strung out guitar that that basically makes up the bulk of the instrumental here, which is a Kurt Cobain sample It&amp;#39;s kind of like Cuddy is taking those grunge vibes that he was trying to execute on speeding bullet to heaven But giving them the the song the platform they finally deserve also I love the way the track transitions from these dirty grimy lowdown verses to these heavenly Vocal harmonies with Cuddy singing out into the ether with a lot of reverb on his voice. Whoa Whoa, then all these incredibly eerie auto-tune vocal harmonies shoot back stay strong Lord shine a light on me, save me please. Damn, the vocal melodies. They put together on this track is just incredible Kanye&amp;#39;s verse is fantastic on this thing too displaying this cycle of violence Like really one of his most conscious sets of bars and years this whole idea of asking or begging to be saved by this supernatural power for a record like this to me is a pretty powerful sentiment to end on I also love some of the psychedelics since that go into this track - again enhancing that neo psychedelic edge and just what a fantastic collection of tracks and I don&amp;#39;t necessarily see this album as just simply being a standalone thing I very much see this record and &amp;quot;Ye&amp;quot; to be connected Somehow. Making it difficult for me personally to look at this and say oh, you know, it&amp;#39;s just seven tracks It&amp;#39;s just twenty minutes of music. No, I mean in the grander scheme of things, I feel like this album is very much tied to --Ye&amp;#39;s recent release but the track listing on this thing is so Freakin watertight. There&amp;#39;s not a song on this that I don&amp;#39;t love - some agree or I don&amp;#39;t think adds to the tracklisting fantastically every song builds on the next to create this overwhelming mind-altering and strangely beautiful vibe I truly feel like Kanye and Cuddy put one another artistically to the test on this thing with an amazing mix of emotion sound and genres all of which are super vivid just crashing into one another in this violently beautiful display It&amp;#39;s like the cosmos imploding and reality melting and the The Matrix glitching and I&amp;#39;m also super impressed with how forward-thinking Difficult to pin down and futuristic. This album feels - I am legit feelin a strong 9 - a 10 on this thing What do you what do you think of that? *snoring* Hey, hey, what do you what do you is this is this exciting to you? Is this does this interest you at all? *more snoring* Well, I liked it I liked it a lot. Transition have you given this album a listen, did you love it? Did you hate it? What would you rate it?

    "transcript": "hi everyone Anthony fantano here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of the new Swan&amp;#39;s record to be kind I know this this review it&amp;#39;s a little late but you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s two hours long give me a break hey give him a break give me a break give him a break what is on your wall give him a break what is on your wall are you spoiling the review right now I didn&amp;#39;t mean to get on the thing put your face on the thing spoiler this is the latest LP from the long running experimental rock band that formed over 30 years ago Swans in that 30 years the band has gone through a lot of albums and lineup changes live records and a breakup as well as a subsequent Reformation there&amp;#39;s been a lot of Sonic Evolution as well in their &amp;#39; 80s the 90s output you can hear everything from the grading sounds of noise Rock no wave and Industrial to Post Punk ambient music post rock as well as Folk Rock and Gothic Rock leading up to the point when the band broke up Annie don&amp;#39;t be sort depressed s worried depressed people don&amp;#39;t really just care about the score they really just want to hear what you got to say about the music cuz they love you so much you don&amp;#39;t think so yeah I know so you know what I think you&amp;#39;re right I believe in you yeah I&amp;#39;m gonna do it with with all my heart and emotions you go girl even though there&amp;#39;s all these various genres in Swan&amp;#39;s past they seem to be onto something kind of new with this latest string of Records they&amp;#39;ve been working on which I actually think started a little rocky with the lp my father will guide me up a rope the years between this record and 1996&amp;#39;s soundtracks for the blind were not spent completely silent I believe there was a swans bsides that came out and Michael jro was spending a lot of time on solo efforts collaborations and bands like angels of Light which swans was sounding eerily alike when they came out with this comeback record over here however the sort of Gothic folk and Country Vibes that came through in that project were changed significantly once swans dropped the sear in 2012 it was a record that saw the band filling out their sound with backup vocals electric guitar viop phone damer woodwinds posos synths Chimes Swan&amp;#39;s ambition was unignorable from an instrumental standpoint but from a compositional standpoint as well since this record had some of the group&amp;#39;s most long and challenging material yet especially with the 32-minute title track on this thing it was material that was just unsettling very disturbing hair raising but explosive as well and groove heavy too like on tracks such as mother of the world which has these just stuttering ing riffs that repeat repeat repeat repeat and swans take these repetitive stuttering riffs and just build and build and build on them with larger instrumentation or they managed to bring a really clever musical transition through moments like this in a way sort of reminded me of the songw writing that swans were embarking on with the longer tracks off of soundtracks for the blind with the constantly ascending instrumentation on those songs but they were definitely going for a different vibe and they had just a larger more grander presentation on the sear it&amp;#39;s like on this record they really returned to improve upon the formula they were working with in the mid99s so it&amp;#39;s no surprise that on this latest record from swans we see these folk influences drift away even further and instead we&amp;#39;re getting this larger emphasis on heaviness on instrumental density on slow incremental progression with a lot of these songs as they move along becoming hulking monstrosities that are impossible to take down it swans as you might already know them if you gave a listen to The Seer back in 2012 but in the meantime since that album was released I think they&amp;#39;ve done a great job of improving upon that formula as well with better production brighter guitars heavier bass more overwhelming crescendos intense off-the-wall vocal performances from frontman and Main brain Michael jira and most importantly I think swans does a fantastic job of just keeping the tension up in a lot of these songs especially the more aggressive and Lively tracks on this album I think to be kind displays a Mastery of tension another reason you might be familiar with swan sound on this record is if you&amp;#39;ve been paying close attention to the band for the past few years because a lot of this material is kind of already out songs like to be kind have been in the swans live set since the Seer tour at least and a load of the songs on to be kind ended up on a live SL demo CD that swans did a limited run of not too long ago not here not now however the material on that CD takes on an entirely different life on this record and uh the presentation is is no less amazing despite the exposure that these songs have already gotten screen shot the first song off of this LP kicks the entire record off perfectly it starts with this quiet hypnotic little Rift that has a Sinister swing to it then the drums pop in they sound so crisp they sound so fantastic they sound so clear throughout this entire record I just love the drum sounds on this thing shout out to John congleton and the band slowly builds the pace and the sound and the instrumentation of this track up piece by piece by piece they take huge cues from minimalism on this record and just how these songs move forward the progressions that this track and others bring to the table are just so seamless they move so fluidly it&amp;#39;s beautiful and I love the Crescendo that this song builds up to it&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re really just working on creating this sense of emotional pressure that they hold until the very last moment lyrically Michael jira goes through a lot of words pairing them the word no no this no that no this no that and these words all seem to have some kind of Common Thread running through them no dreams no suffering no time no pain Etc a lot of the words that Michael jir is saying no to I think have a lot to do with humanity and just the the idea of life as well as religion we could potentially have all this freedom and yet we put all these barriers around ourselves for the most part that we make up or at least that&amp;#39;s what I get from the track I mean putting the word no in front of a bunch of words over and over and over again at the end of the day is kind of vague in a way so I&amp;#39;m sure there are going to be people out there that come to different conclusions than me however it still ended up being an interesting thing to read into as I was listening to this record and there are similar lyrical and compositional themes that run through the other songs on this record too like the song some things we do which is this somber 5 minute string piece with very chilly stone-faced vocals fronting the song and even though 5 minutes is not really a short amount of time for a song the track does feel comparatively short to the other tracks here considering the track comes right after one of the most intense songs on the record and how relaxed it is throughout the entirety of its length it&amp;#39;s kind of like an interlude and lyrically we have a similar pattern instead of know this know that we have we this we that we love we learn we taste we [ __ ] we touch Michael jir seems completely obsessed with the things that we do whether it be by choice or by Nature conditioning I think in a way Michael might be kind of disappointed with the limitations that mankind has on it whether they are self-imposed or otherwise the song a little God in my hands also takes this repetitive riff structure building and building and building but starts off much funkier much more rhythmic it&amp;#39;s one of the moments here where swans takes an already loud and very engaging and very visceral piece of rock music and then just makes it louder and louder and louder there are some amazingly overwhelming walls of horns and glitchy synthesizers on this track that just make my mouth peel back every time to smile because man are they just earpiercing body destroying not only that but just the flavor the tone of the music on this song It&amp;#39;s So cartoonishly villainous like just imagine the worst villain you&amp;#39;ve ever seen ever he&amp;#39;s twirling his mustache he has a cape he&amp;#39;s tying damsels and kittens and babies to train tracks and again we get another similar lyrical pattern there are Parts where Michael jira does divert from this pattern on this song but we&amp;#39;re getting forever this forever that forever lazy and I dare say this song sounds a little Primacy a lot of the same riff build repetition characteristics show up on Natalie Neil as well as oxygen which I think starts off more aggressive than any other track here especially when it comes to the rhythms and just the pace of the song This is a much faster track than many other tracks here and even though it&amp;#39;s 8 minutes long this this really is swans at their most straightforward on this record especially with Michael jer&amp;#39;s really animalistic vocal performance feed me now I get out the oxygen this is the most insane he sounded since Swan&amp;#39;s early days on records like greed and filth and cop and in a way I don&amp;#39;t think this record is too far off from what those early swans LPS do formulaically the ugly the repetition the Primal appeal of the drums and the grooves however with to be kind this formula is being taken to a more refined and complex level and managing to stir up a slew of different emotions in the process process like with the track bring the sun which is the first half of this longest song at 34 minutes and it has one of the most crushing introductions of any song on this album with all this instrumentation just piling on top of one another puming on this one note over and over and over it is so heavy and yet very bright and Blissful it&amp;#39;s just the power of sound on display on this thing and these rips eventually give way to a drone it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m listening to swans embrace the idea of music or Sound as a religious experience something that mentally can set you free bring you to a higher plane because simultaneously while Swan&amp;#39;s music is very loud and it is very visceral I think there are loads of cerebral appeals to the music on this thing too there are moments on this record that I think are meditative as well as hellish and fearful it&amp;#39;s like so many songs here just function on the most basic of human emotions this album is primordial Beginnings evolving into complex networks of instrumentation that are all marching to the beat of the same drum becoming more advanced as they move forward all focused on the same goal in the same way that like an ant colony would be or the human race itself without being fully conscious of it but with every song here that goes in this direction the power and the sound and the size of the music becomes so great that it eventually just crumbles under its own power that&amp;#39;s essentially the end of the song bring the Sun and then we have this transition over to two s which sort of seems like the calm after the storm for a moment but then eventually there&amp;#39;s all these noisy riffs hammering down with such relentlessness and speed and ferocity it&amp;#39;s like what was once organized has devolved into chaos the guitars and the drums become this wall of noise Feeding Frenzy all ferociously tearing away at the same rotting corpse and then the instrumentation grows from that into something organized once again which is kind of the cycle of life and and things on this record this beginning order growth Mayhem death cycle which actually might not be too far-fetched of a theory considering that the second half of this track is named after the Haitian revolutionary that helped put into motion the revolution that eventually freed his country from its French oppressors in the early 1700s and late 1800s and on this track Michael jira brings one of the most insane vocal deliver memories of any track on this record really just sort of shouting to S there are moments on this song that devolve simply into Michael rolling his RS and barking it&amp;#39;s just another amazingly intense moment that this this record serves up and then there&amp;#39;s tracks on here that I think break up the vibe of the album a little bit like the song just a little boy which oddly enough the the very weird soundscape of this song as well as the Oddball VOC kind of remind me of some tracks from David Lynch&amp;#39;s latest few musical efforts and in the title of the song itself it says it&amp;#39;s dedicated to Chester Bernard AKA Howen wolf one of the most enigmatic blues singers and songwriters of all time and I think swans actually live up to that dedication with how bluesy the drum beat and the Baseline of this track are but of course for this album they&amp;#39;re slow down to the PACE at which a predator pursues its prey sneakily this track doesn&amp;#39;t contain one of the more more climactic Builds on the entire album but it&amp;#39;s still really riveting with Michael jro&amp;#39;s vocal delivery and all this maniacal laughter that plays here and there throughout the track I also love the atmospheric drone behind this song and the strung out slide guitars the lumbering Groove which feels incredibly woozy then there&amp;#39;s the song she loves us one of the more multifaceted tracks on the entire LP starts off with one of the most gnarly riffs here after several minutes devolves into these noisy dark pummeling chaotic riffs and the last 10 minutes are spent sort of with this jangly really in a way joyous psychedelic Rock instrumentation that just grows more and more and more Sinister reminds me of the Stooges in some respects sort of like listening to uh I want to be your dog it just has a very steady steady patient Pace to it but continues to build and build and build further and further and further as it reaches the end point of course meanwhile Michael tiira is shouting more vital over the instrumentation here your name is [ __ ] backing all this very lwd lyricism a lot of which has to do with sex with hallelu another Moment On This Record bringing very Primal human Necessities functions instincts together with religious imagery there&amp;#39;s Kirsten supine which starts off as one of the most beautiful songs on the entire LP a really pretty ballad with these sparkling Melodies hanging behind the vocals and it just hits another Fant fantastic skipping groove on the second half of the track which just builds up into eternity and explodes toward the end and the finisher on here to be kind has one of the most crushing blows of a finish on the entire record and is completely deserving of of the throne which it has been given on the of this thing swans just do such a fantastic job on this record they do such a great job taking this very clear formula and just applying it in so many different ways bringing a decent amount of variety to the record instrumental variety emotional variety there are pretty songs on here there are hard-hitting songs on here there are slow burners there are more direct moments and even though yeah it&amp;#39;s not as long as soundtracks for the blind that record to me is is not really a holistic album in the way to be kind is soundtracks for the blind was was you know literally a soundtrack for a movie that didn&amp;#39;t really exist that was kind of the the mental idea that swans had going into that record to be kind to me is Swan&amp;#39;s most cohesive while ambitious album yet and this plays into why these songs are so long but I think swans actually have expanded the notion of incing rock instrumentation on this LP the songs on this record significantly blur the lines between exciting and numbing and not only is the recording amazing the pacing of these songs is fantastic they&amp;#39;re just so many interesting passages and twisted layers to these songs this thing is just so captivating and live and free flowing and yet it feels so meticulously placed together and on top of all of that I find this excitement SL numbness ambiguity really intriguing I&amp;#39;m feeling a 10 it&amp;#39;s a CH transition if you&amp;#39;ve given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that&amp;#39;s a WS to be kind forever"

    "genre": "Industrial Hip Hop",
    "transcript": "you know there&amp;#39;s some people are actually in comas and their faces really get frozen like that really come on man hi everyone anthony fantano here internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review death grips the money store death grips is a sacramento-based experimental hip-hop trio featuring m.c ride on vocals and zack hill and flat lander kind of handling the production behind things and the mixtape they put out last year x military ended up being my second favorite album of the year when it came time to do lists and the reason this landed is as second in my favorite albums of the years because it&amp;#39;s such a forward-thinking hip-hop album i&amp;#39;m not trying to say that it was really socially conscious or it&amp;#39;s trying to save hip-hop if death grips and ex-military were trying to save hip-hop they were definitely going about it in a really weird way because that album to me just takes all of hip-hop&amp;#39;s worst stereotypes and turns them up to a deafening volume everything becomes extreme from the over modulation of really heavy bass in the beats to the overuse of violence and aggression in the lyrics and the vocal delivery with m.c ride just really reaching levels of serial killer psycho insanity i would say death grips definitely takes influence from bomb squad style production that was put together for some of public enemies best releases and songs as well as the really testosterone soaked cutthroat aggression that was on wu tang&amp;#39;s first album 36 chambers but death grips has taken these things so far that what they&amp;#39;re making is no longer just hip-hop but but hip-hop blended with elements of noise and industrial music and jittery electronica yeah the money store definitely has roots in traditional hip-hop but it is not an album for hip-hop traditionalists the beats for one are so freaking noisy sharing a lot of characteristics with the solo albums that zack hill has been releasing over the years since since hella has kind of cooled down and the vocals the lyrics just get swallowed in all of this chaos created by the instrumentals and the the screaming vocal delivery of mc ride just distorts the lyrics even further if you do concentrate really hard the lyrics on this thing are slightly readable you do kind of get a grasp as to maybe what&amp;#39;s sort of being said but death grips is fully conscious of this and how important lyrics and stories are in hip-hop which i think is is part of why the trio continues to post its lyrics in full with every single new song they release and their lyrics worth reading into because they add a whole different different dynamic to the aggression that death grips presents the aggression and the violence that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s glorified in a lot of hip-hop music especially in the mainstream with this album is just brought to such a high it becomes a grim reality not something to admire not something to like in his lyrics m.c ryde kind of paints himself as this character who is very violent paranoid intoxicated nearly all the time and living an extremely low life lifestyle kind of like the cover of this album it&amp;#39;s something that feels like it&amp;#39;s coming straight out of a really gritty graphic novel i can see all of m c ride&amp;#39;s exploits on this lp in the lyrics being depicted in really stark black and white images depicting bodies and bullets and blades and blood spray it&amp;#39;s the kind of stuff that to me people would usually label horror core but because of how extreme death grips is sonically and and vocally they totally sidestep that label because now this album has kind of set the bar a little bit higher anybody walking down that road might as well be making halloween music m.c rides lyrics do kind of function beyond just gore though like on the song get got where he&amp;#39;s kind of imagining police going after him that aren&amp;#39;t really there and on the track i&amp;#39;ve seen footage he raps about the police brutality and violence that he&amp;#39;s seen that kind of fuels that that paranoia the track lost boy sort of seems to be this really dark tribute to anybody who&amp;#39;s lost themselves in a gutter-esque lifestyle brown baggers thieves drug dealers highlighting with the hook just how far people can fall on the track hacker the lyrics are so out there and disconnected simultaneously name dropping wikileaks tesla and lady gaga in a way that that kind of feels really glitchy and disorienting which the the song title kind of asserts and the track system blower kind of seems to be a bit of a double entendre obviously a car system comes to mind and that is referenced in the lyrics but with how violent m.c ride gets with his words on a lot of verses in this track to me it kind of feels like he&amp;#39;s also pointing his anger at the construct of systems possibly those tracks are great those tracks are fine but most of this album is loaded with violent violent make sure a parent is around kind of content blood curdling images of cinder blocks being tied to feed and being tortured and blades again scars bubonic plague fire war bare knuckle brawls with people who are at punk weight sitting all the way through this album can be a lot like a clockwork orange and you&amp;#39;re kind of tied to your chair and your eyelids are peeled back and you&amp;#39;re just being exposed to all this horrifying soul rotting imagery sometimes the lyrics can be really over the top like on the track [ __ ] please where the hook goes like [ __ ] please you must be smoking but that&amp;#39;s kind of part of this really trashy unapologetic character that that m.c ride depicts he&amp;#39;s supposed to be an unlikable bastard i can&amp;#39;t help but compare the character on this album to like walk a flock of flame except actually scary and aggressive and dangerous not this slick money-making gangsta image of aggression but no matter how gory the lyrics get m.c ride is a character he is also a narrator he can&amp;#39;t be him if you know what i&amp;#39;m saying because i don&amp;#39;t know of many drug-addicted cold-blooded killer street dwellers who would use the words basilisk or lycanthropy in their rap verses the last thing i want to say about the lyrics though is that death grips just knows how to write a hell of a hook get get get get got got got i&amp;#39;m in your area it&amp;#39;s such a long way down double double every track on here is amazingly catchy which is a feat considering how ugly and harsh and uninviting this album is if you can withstand the force a lot of these tracks are going to stick with you it&amp;#39;s kind of like wanting to join a gang and then of course upon entry you get hazed and beaten up and abused but once you kind of make it through that initial rough spot you&amp;#39;re in the gang and everything&amp;#39;s cool on some tracks here mc rides versus and flow get really fast like at the song get get get god or double helix he makes use of the more kind of normal or quiet registers in his voice too when rapping on those songs which really gives this album a lot more variety in comparison with ex-military of course the lyrics no matter what register they&amp;#39;re delivered at would not mean much if not for death grips production and i would say if there&amp;#39;s one thing on this album that is done to perfection it is to stick with death grip&amp;#39;s usual style without bringing me into any major bouts of deja vu in relation to ex-military or the ep that came out before get got was the first single to come out from this lp and death grips i think really wanted to say hey we were going to do something different this time around here is our quietest song yet there are these swirling synthesizers that kind of bleed into one another because of how grainy and lo-fi the sound quality is the vocals feel just claustrophobically close to the microphone there are these kind of twittering hi-hat drums in between some of the verses some very robotically looped vocal skips i love it the song fever by contrast the song right after is just pure hell the track is like listening to an alarm go off in the middle of a an underground government-funded lab where a genetically engineered mutant has just broke out and is on the loose zach hill&amp;#39;s drums sound really ragged and his bass drum patterns on the song are insane tons of precision and the hook on this thing when the synthesizers come in it just sounds so slick just so freaking memorable the track lost boyz takes a much different approach from the previous two tracks and is really airy and atmospheric mc ride&amp;#39;s vocals are just wrapped up in the atmosphere it sounds like he&amp;#39;s rapping from the bottom of a low-life well where all the terrible people he&amp;#39;s rapping about live the beat is so off-kilter on this track it skips quite literally like a broken record and is really hypnotic because of it the track right after blackjack is really mesmerizing too and the vocals have these kind of poltergeist-esque vocal sound reversals playing behind the wrap verses that gives this song just a really surreal quality and with this fat synthesizer pulsating in the background with with some dissonance synths as well it just feels like something out of a an 80s b slasher movie death grips works on kind of topping its dark and heavy tracks from x military like tachyon with songs on here such as system blower and the cage and death grips delivers some serious left hooks on this album too really surprisingly just when i thought i had their style pinned down song kind of example case in point i&amp;#39;ve seen footage which is this track that i feel like kind of was made just to tease the naysayers saying that death grips is not hip-hop because the song while staying completely death grips in just being abrasive being hip-hop being just so in your face the way the drum beat works the distorted riff as well as mc rides flow all call out to golden age hip-hop artists like run dmc salt and pepper tone loc and the track hacker has this beat that&amp;#39;s kind of like this very danceable 80s style electro funk with mc ride i i would say kind of rapping but it sort of feels like spoken word too because he&amp;#39;s really screaming just a lot of disjointed phrases and more than anything more than hip-hop the track reminds me of of like lcd sound system when james murphy would set up a track with a really strong groove and then just go off on all these really insane ramblings but you know death grips has already wrapped over a link raised sample on x military so at this point really anything goes the track [ __ ] please feels really kind of schizophrenic one moment you&amp;#39;re hearing this rising fat synthesizer the next moment mc ryde is wrapping in a jamaican accent every few bars kind of presents a completely different sound it is just a blender of different ideas the track [ __ ] that by far has the oddest groove on this entire thing right up there with lost boys man every track here musically just has its own personality just its own set of distinct characteristics there&amp;#39;s just so much detail in these instrumentals that it gets so minute it would take hours to explain exactly what&amp;#39;s happening with every single track but despite all this detailed death grips music does not really sound all that studied or hoity toity or anything like that it&amp;#39;s very fun music it&amp;#39;s very straightforward noisy catchy overwhelming blood pumping music it is really visceral it is really in your face but once you kind of get a grip of what&amp;#39;s going on and you adjust to the intensity it&amp;#39;s easier to step back and see that the album required more of this than it did because not only is this lp really heavy and abrasive but it&amp;#39;s also thought provoking it&amp;#39;s extremely layered and does not give up all of its secrets in the first second or even tenth listen despite being very loud to be completely honest i&amp;#39;ve listened to x military a lot of times but this album still managed to kind of blow my mind death grips material so far has been building a really interesting new sound for hip-hop i&amp;#39;m not saying they&amp;#39;re changing the game or anything like that i don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the intention of this album at all instead the money store looks to kind of forge something for itself this thing is sitting on a throne of its own design and nobody&amp;#39;s watching because the picture is just too horrifying to stare at from the cover of this album to the lyrics to the vocal delivery to the production everything about this lp is just unsettling is disturbing is surreal the words twisted and unforgiving come to mind too but so does the word rewarding to put it simply this album is to me a sonic portrait of a villain villains represent evil but the thing is each decade each generation is going to come up with its own brand of villainy of its own brand of evil because the evil and the villains of the previous generations are going to to the current generation feel soft feel old hat things need to be updated death grips the money store is that successfully reinvented image of the villain or just villainy in general i&amp;#39;m loving this record freaking loving this record freaking freaking loving this record can&amp;#39;t really say much else about it kind of feeling a strong nine to a 10 on this lp what do you guys think of it do you love it do you hate it why why do you hate it why seriously why do you hate it and why do you love it too why do you love it let me know anthony fantano death grips forever [Music]"

    "transcript": "bam hey everyone Anthony fantano here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of the new Kendrick Lamar album to pimp a butterfly review it he&amp;#39;s going to review it he&amp;#39;s going to review it West Coast rapper black hippie member Top Dog entertainment member Kendrick Lamar and I&amp;#39;ve been telling you telling you since 2011 Kendrick Lamar has something he&amp;#39;s got something going on Section 80 great album an album on which Kendrick showcased a kind of nasal high-pitched voice but a lot of Personality he had flow he had a lot to say and he had a knack for writing catchy kind of accessible enjoyable hip-hop songs with a socially aware Edge a talent he would go on to sharpen with his next full length LP good kid Mad City an album that in a few short years has been widely acknowledged as one of Hip Hop&amp;#39;s best records and one of mod music&amp;#39;s best concept albums This Record told the story a story of a young Kendrick Lamar or maybe many a young man from Compton California caught up in dreams of success peer pressure drugs gang violence the record is a fantastic nuanced and very detailed character portrait this was really Kendrick Lamar&amp;#39;s breakout album he was sounding so much less like an outsider with this LP with the Drake feature the trendier beats the Dr Dre feature big singles like swimming pools that had a trap influenced instrumental as well as a message that was obviously anti-substance abuse but the song was kind of masked as a drinking song even though I loved This Record when it came out and I still love it now I couldn&amp;#39;t help it feel like Kendrick kind of compromised on this album I&amp;#39;m going to make trendier music but I&amp;#39;m going to do it on my own terms and even if it is trendier I don&amp;#39;t really mind if the music itself and the the message Behind the Music is fantastic but I was left after this album wondering where could Kendrick go after this will he continue to try to appeal to more mainstream tastes in a way I felt like that might have been the case the first time I heard I the blend of pop music hip-hop and Soul on that track certainly had kind of a radio friendly sound and the track actually ended up winning Kendrick a few Grammys kind of proving that song&amp;#39;s pop appeal but instead of just hanging in this safe Zone and and making blander music kendri continued to experiment and make some pretty old statements like with the track black or the berry then we started getting word of some of Kendrick&amp;#39;s collaborators and producers on this record people like flying Lotus George Clinton of Parliament Funkadelic basist extraordinaire Thundercat underrated femc raps City one of the Eisley brothers and neo soul singer balal among others and this change really shows up in the sound of this album there is not a trendy instrumental in sight anywhere on this record there is no swimming pools and Kendrick is very upfront with the Sonic direction of this album with a lot of strong instrumentals pulling from Jazz some really groovy Parliament Funkadelic inspired drums and bass psychedelic smooth dreamy creamy Neo Soul the instrumental flavor of this record has a distinctly Old School tone to it like Kendrick is really going back to the Glory Days of Dr Dre Snoop The Far Side and Tupac but there&amp;#39;s something really modern in detailed about these beats too Kendrick even pulls a left hook in the track listing here by tossing in a live performance version of the song I rather than leaving in the gussied up studio version which I actually prefer this move the raw aesthetic of the live performance of this track sounds fantastic The Isley Brothers sample interpolation on the song goes over pretty well and there&amp;#39;s kind of an outcast heya Vibe on this track too throwing this version on the record actually plays Into The Narrative of the album this Anthem about self-love and self-esteem I think in a way Kendrick kind of sees this song as falling on deaf ears with the crowd of people he&amp;#39;s trying to communicate it to which is why toward the end of the song the track gets derailed by a really kind of I guess angry frustrated and and Restless crowd with whom Kendrick tries to plead and asks for you know calmness civility telling him that black people are tired of playing the victim saying that he has no time to waste time the very next track on here mortal man you kind of see Kendrick Lamar lyrically questioning the devotion of his fans asking them if they will still be a fan when the [ __ ] hits the fan and it&amp;#39;s stuff like this that sets Kendrick apart from not just other rappers but specifically other conscious rappers while it seems like Kendrick might want to fix the world in a way I think he kind of sees it as feudal or maybe even like an impossible task but for an like Kendrick changing Minds with your art is a worthy cause worth the effort even if the boulder of problems in front of you moves just only an inch after you&amp;#39;ve dropped dead of exhaustion after all of your trying to pimp a butterfly is structured in a pretty interesting way it&amp;#39;s not a story album it&amp;#39;s not another good kid Mad City it&amp;#39;s like a series of separate but very much connected vignettes and given how dramatic and Grand and Rich a lot of the instrumentation and the vocal performances on this record are I actually feel like I&amp;#39;m watching not just listening but watching in my mind a really elaborate stage show and that is not a far-fetched comparison considering all the strange Sonic detours on this record the effects the instrumental interludes the various voices we have Kendrick changing up his flow his voice his inflection constantly a pretty wide instrumental pallet you have smooth sexy funk music music on here like with the song these walls and then you have hardcore hipop with just a little bit of &amp;#39;90s boombap inspiration on black or the berry and this is something I&amp;#39;ve never heard before we have this poem being told at the end or maybe at the very beginning of nearly every track on this album and as Kendrick starts this poem with each attempt he just gets a little further into the poem each time reciting what he has already said in the poem on previous tracks and whatever words he leaves off on before the next track starts sort of dictate the theme or somehow tell you about the oncoming track and then at the very end of the album he tells the entire poem that he&amp;#39;s written and it reveals a few different things one that this entire poem ties up very beautifully every single theme on the album and the second thing that&amp;#39;s revealed is that the entire time Kendrick has been telling this poem to Tupac yes he&amp;#39;s telling this poem to Tupac he just sort of you know talks a little bit after he&amp;#39;s finished and you know goes to ask a question and and who is answering back uh none other than Tupac Shakur and Kendrick continues to converse with this no longer alive man about things like politics and money and success in the music industry in a very natural way I thought this was like an actor or maybe some some kind of crazy voice hologram thing because you know we had the danc and Snoop Dogg Tupac hologram thing thing thing but then I came to learn that everything Tupac is saying comes from this old interview recorded in the 990s Kendrick took his favorite Snippets from it and then wrote the questions afterwards and pulled together this just beautifully cohesive conversation it&amp;#39;s really a mind [ __ ] moment and then he ends the entire track off with another poem recitation that actually sort of ties up and explains the whole to pimp a butterfly theme which is actually pretty beautiful and uh makes me feel bad for anybody who is uh you know currently hating on the title of this album because it actually has quite a bit of poignance and meaning if you actually pay attention to the final words of this record so there are some completely new and whacked out things that Kendrick does all over this record and and every single one of them goes over incredibly well flying colors and he has a lot to say on this record as well like with his previous albums and even though Kendrick on this album is addressing a lot of hot button issues uh taking on things that we see as as being very large and very political he brings it down and makes it personal makes it relatable or at least emotional or something to sympathize with he&amp;#39;s not this rapper Who&amp;#39;s just going to like spit statistics at you like oh this many people died feel something rather than that Kendrick gives you a compelling point of view or at least connects the dots so that you can kind of see why someone would have the mindset that he has or the mindset of people who he might be talking about or portraying on this album he does this as he wraps about black artists who are blinded by money and fame and success while simultaneously being exploited by the music industry he wraps about living up to Musical and political Heroes he wraps about trying to stay in touch with his roots and his neighborhood and his friends while being this really prominent entertainment figure we have black pride and black confidence on this record but also conversely racism versus the black community and the black community versus the black community and his lyrics are consistently witty and thoughtful and poetic and Nuance but there are moments on here where Kendrick doesn&amp;#39;t really mince words either one line in particular that it&amp;#39;s actually pretty awesome where he&amp;#39;s talking about music critics saying that they miss when rap was about rapping if that were the case [ __ ] Killer Mike would be platinum I agree as well as Kendrick&amp;#39;s proclamations of this dick ain&amp;#39;t free on the for free interlude track where he&amp;#39;s kind of talking about issues of slavery and sexuality on the song Too a track that fuses together beat poetry Jazz and like this Saul williamses Insanity it was really a moment for me on the album when I first heard it I thought is this genius or is this garbage but but it only took one more listen to figure out yeah yeah it&amp;#39;s genius and this track actually has the biggest sense of humor of any song here while this record does have a few bones to pick it&amp;#39;s not necessarily just Kendrick shoving an ID theology down your throat or even really tell you what to think because there are moments here where Kendrick will say something out of one side of his mouth and then maybe he&amp;#39;ll contradict himself a little but not necessarily just contradicting himself I sort of see it as him trying to engage with maybe every side of the issues he&amp;#39;s trying to tackle showing that heavy problems such as the ones addressed on this record aren&amp;#39;t just black and white they&amp;#39;re layered onions that have a lot of different factors but despite his best intentions there will always be people who the moment they feel something political is going on in a piece of art they will reel back thinking they&amp;#39;re too good to be told anyone else&amp;#39;s point of view because they know the way the world works and even if you are that kind of person I ask you to give this album a fair shot because it&amp;#39;s not like Kendrick half asses his bars on this record I think he tries to give these topics a lot of care he&amp;#39;s not delivering some kind of reblogged 140 character bumper sticker philos phos ophy on this album if you listen to these songs and all you get from them is Kendrick&amp;#39;s just bitching about being black in America Kendrick thinks white people suck well that&amp;#39;s really kind of a basic point of view and not because Kendrick&amp;#39;s being basic because you&amp;#39;re being basic so get off that and really listen to what he&amp;#39;s trying to say on this record cuz the way Kendrick goes about addressing things like race and sex and fame and money on this album is so Artful that this record could go toe to- Toe with any album that tries to address wider social issues this entire LP kicks off with the incredibly funky fun and mystical Wesley&amp;#39;s Theory wait backup the entire record actually starts off with a sample of this Boris Garder song which If You Give a listen to this track it&amp;#39;s actually a really fantastic Manifesto for a lot of the moments on this album that have kind of a a racial Pride angle to them so do give this track a listen if you want a bit more context for this album album but really with this track Kendrick is kind of tipping a hat to Mr Wesley Snipes and on the verses here he&amp;#39;s rapping as characters once again in the first verse he&amp;#39;s a successful artist who is blinded by the fame and wants to throw his money away on everything the second verse here we have an Uncle Sam character who is kind of taking advantage of this artist&amp;#39;s ignorance to the industry and his moneymaking capability on this track Kendrick tries to portray that that this type of success comes with its risks and its debts the instrumental here is fantastic with appearances from George Clinton I love his lyrics on this track I love his vocal delivery look both ways before you cross my mind Thundercats base on here fantastic and these whaling G Funk synthesizers are great too thematically the song for sale which is a very psychedelic dreamy interlude track it&amp;#39;s actually longer than a lot of the other tracks here but interlude all the same uh this track is gorgeous andh talks about a lot of the same stuff moving forward we get the P Funk James Brown concoction of King counta and with all the cartoony and zany background vocals and the kind of sad guitar line on this track as well as the uppity flow uh I dare say the song feels a little like old school Eminem influence too and on this track we see Kendrick kind of portraying himself as coming from just lowly Beginnings but now that he&amp;#39;s at his artistic Peak or at least what we think is his artistic Peak right now he is kind of this King counta figure the song These Walls is an incredibly sexy track about sex as well as abusing one&amp;#39;s Fame I think to get laid which plays into the bit of the poem that was recited right before this track Kendrick actually makes direct reference to this poem in the third verse of this song where he says he&amp;#39;s sleeping with this girl whose uh man might actually be like in jail right now then we have songs like institutionalized where Kendrick has a lot of love for and a really strong desire to return to his old neighborhood despite the fact that he&amp;#39;s this great success now and he could really live anywhere he wants to and it&amp;#39;s a really multifaceted track with one beat shift after another but sort of bringing the track from one moment to the next is a Snoop Dogg with kind of a Slick Rick flow inspired by the track children story one of my favorite hip-hop songs of all time and also on this track too we have Kendrick making reference to his grandmother on one of the refrains here talking about if you want [ __ ] to change uh you better clean or wipe your ass sort of putting it on Kendrick that if he wants things to change if he wants things to be different he has to enact that change he has to put in the work in order to make that change occur that personal responsibility I sort of see as another major theme of this album especially on tracks like the very intense song you where Kendrick sort of puts on himself uh a lot of bad things going down with family with friends maybe not blaming himself directly but sort of getting really angry at himself tearing himself apart emotionally for like not being there for his relatives and for the death of a friend the second half of this song is incredibly heartbreaking and has Kendrick whipping out that flow where his voice is cracking and breaking all over the place a lot like on the song Mad City but rather than kind of pulling out this voice to portray like a a young innocent kid uh he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s really just broken up and drinking and you like get the bottle sounds in this album here it&amp;#39;s like he&amp;#39;s drinking in the middle of his verses literally I mean you hear the alcohol swishing around you hear the lip smacking against the bottle and being there for people who are close to you for your family are themes that come up again on tracks like Mama as well as Hood politics when these songs begin they end on a moment in the poem where Kendrick is just going totally insane due to the very Lush Life he&amp;#39;s been living and he is going back to his home for answers he kind of mocks himself a little bit saying that you know because he made this Grand comment on the place where he&amp;#39;s from he knows everything when in reality he kind of feels out of touch and with the track Hood politics I don&amp;#39;t totally have this track deciphered but the way I&amp;#39;m interpreting it thus far it&amp;#39;s a little bit like the art of peer pressure part two he&amp;#39;s returning home and maybe falling back back into his old way of doing things a little bit and maybe how Kendrick&amp;#39;s feeling on this track can be added up to the survivor&amp;#39;s guilt he talks about in the ongoing poem at the end of this song that he inches a little bit further in on and this sort of survivors guilt makes him feel anxious and kind of uncomfortable but this lack of comfort in one&amp;#39;s own skin has kind of put At Ease on the song you ain&amp;#39;t got to lie where Kendrick I think in a way comes to the conclusion that he can be himself but also be be this prominent musical figure a lot like in the same way that we have the song you that is just filled with self-loathing but Kendrick eventually progresses toward I that moment where he has that self-esteem that Pride that and the song I is surrounded by a handful of other tracks that delve into self-love self-hate introspection like black or the berry as well as complexion with Rap City to pimp a butterfly not only comes back to the trappings of Fame but also trying to use one&amp;#39;s status in the music world for a positive gain not just for you but your listeners and just the world that you exist in it&amp;#39;s not a story in the same way that good kid Mad City is a story but we see Kendrick change from this overly indulgent emotional wreck to this bold confident graceful smart Next Level human being uh a few years ago a lot of people got on me when I reviewed good kid Mad City saying uh oh why&amp;#39;d you give it a nine why not a 10 I mean how much better can it get well I think this album answers that question I see to pimpa Butterfly as being more daring more ambitious more unique lyrically stellar and while this album does have a philosophy to divulge Kendrick doesn&amp;#39;t skimp on the music on this album he realizes that making music is about the music if the music under your messages is garbage the music is garbage so he has graced his messages and his point of view and his personal tales on this album with delicate detailed wonderful bits of jazz and Funk and wherever else his heart takes him this album instrumentally would actually be a really sweet listen as well this project really marches to the beat of its own drum and it might be to its detriment to an extent because the people who might have gravitated toward the trendier sounds on good kid Mad City might take a bite of this record and just say yuck instantaneously to some of those people I might say try listening to a hip-hop record that came out before 2010 uh other people though might have a beef with this record being so dense lengthy and kind of difficult to trudge through if you&amp;#39;re not enjoying every single track on this album uh the songs on here do require quite a bit of attention even though I do think there are incredibly catchy standouts throughout the track list here like all right as well as I and Blacker the berry and it&amp;#39;s fantastic that for as famous Kendrick is right now for as Grand as this album is and for all the success that it&amp;#39;s seeing Kendrick has continued to make music that is down to earth and what&amp;#39;s even cooler is some of the most obscure names in the feature list here are sometimes the most prominent people on the record because it was just a few years a ago just several years ago that Kendrick was the underdog in Hip Hop and now he&amp;#39;s making what could possibly be the best rap record of the decade Kendrick has remained incredibly self-aware and down to earth as he has gone through this artistic metamorphosis into a butterfly or really the face of Hip Hop&amp;#39;s Next Generation Kendrick is someone who I think signifies a new chapter and hopefully maybe a a turn of the final page on the remnants of The Bling era that have been holding on for dear life I&amp;#39;m not trying to say every artist should try to make this record I mean you know you only get so many Kendrick Lamar so be happy with the ones that you get but it&amp;#39;s albums like this that people use as benchmarks in musical history and it just happens to be fantastically enjoyable as well I&amp;#39;m feeling a uh K in come in on this record yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah TR it&amp;#39;s 4:00 a.m. I&amp;#39;m going to bed it&amp;#39;s 4:00 a.m. I&amp;#39;m going to bed it&amp;#39;s 4:00 a.m. I&amp;#39;m going to bed"

    "genre": "Synthpop",
    "transcript": "hi everyone disy manano here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new magdalina bay record imaginal disc yet here we have the sophomore album of Pop project magdalina Bay the song writer producer Duo that consists of M tenenbom as well as Matthew Luan who quickly became one of the most beloved Duos on the Underground pop circuit through a really solid combo of great music and DIY marketing because at this point not only is the duo known for crafting a very thoughtful and futuristic synth pop but they&amp;#39;ve also been known to routinely drop Tik toks and social media posts that kind of build up this weird humorous lore around mag Bay and this sort of serious and also sort of cheeky World building exercise uh has most definitely continued as the duo has built up a very passionate cult following racked up some Ray reviews even extending this into the music videos behind the singles on this new album here too the reception of which is proving to be even stronger than that of their last and it&amp;#39;s not hard to see why as in comparison with Mercurial world I think imaginal disc is an improvement an ambitious Improvement on all fronts in terms of Versatility conceptuality attention to detail songwriting production quality there are even points on this record where things come full circle it feels like Matt and Ma go back to their old selves a bit as hardcore fans will recall uh their previous band tabula rasa was more of a Prague and art rock thing and there are numerous tracks on imaginal disc uh where they dabble in exactly that working some pretty epic rock passages into these super layered and expansive pop anthems however once again though the true bread and butter of this album is synth pop that sounds like it was made in a different galaxy a different dimension in alternate reality however the genre palette of this album sees Matt and Ma dabbling in more alternative dance dance pop disco and even psychedelic music too it&amp;#39;s a very diverse journey of sounds much in the same way that Mercurial world was but imaginal dis is most definitely an expansion on that not just sonically but also in terms of runtime too because the length of this album is almost an hour we have 15 tracks with a few interludes in the mix as well all in all it really is a little pop epic and it certainly kick off with that kind of energy on the opening track she looked like me which starts off cute enough with some twinkling keys and Tenon bomb&amp;#39;s very soft Angelic voice but it all quickly grows into this surrealist Ode to self-love and self-image with bright horns and pounding industrial siiz drum hits the lyric C ten inbound describing somebody who resembles her is pretty much her but she&amp;#39;s described to be kind of a different person and there&amp;#39;s an Embrace a feeling of Love overall it&amp;#39;s a great tone Setter that displays just how Grand the production is going to be deeper into the record and it also narratively sets up some of the themes that we&amp;#39;ll be dove into more deeply later following this we have the very slick and groovy killing time which is a sweet bit of synth pop with some great baselines and electric keys on top of which ma sings some very sharp and contemplative lyrics about time the ways in which we use it take it lose track of it uh forget about it in a moment&amp;#39;s notice employing idioms around of course killing time there are also themes of death and mortality that crop up in the track to that I think are explored a little bit more later the true blue interlude on the album uh once again brings up themes and ideas around uh your true self or a new version of yourself being introduced to that version and I think this track very much works as a setup for the following Track image which was a single to the record that upon first listen I wasn&amp;#39;t really Blown Away by Lord knows that Ma has had uh Bolder performances on past mag Bay singles but the song is still a really great piece of linear dance pop with some undeniable grooves uh the whole track honestly would work as an instrumental version too like if you dropped it into a DJ set it&amp;#39;s that good it&amp;#39;s that funky but I appreciate M&amp;#39;s vocals so much more in the context of the record because they do bring a beautiful eeriness to the whole thing and once again it does add to some overarching themes on the entire entire album especially on the intro where you&amp;#39;re talking about uh kind of meeting a version of yourself a brand new image in this uh instance meanwhile mortality and love turn up once again as themes on the track death and romance which stylistically is kind of like a &amp;#39;90s alternative dance throwback with some nice psychedelic touches in the production once again there&amp;#39;s an eerie Beauty to this track is there is a Bittersweet contrast between the very sweet dancable instrumental and what&amp;#39;s going on in the lyrics as ma describes this very dark but profound portrayal of love being something where uh you give till it&amp;#39;s all that you have and you know nothing is fair in death and romance you know till death do us part in so many words musically and structurally fear sex is kind of a quick interlude moment that is uh passable for the most part though I do think it does add some interesting narrative and conspiratorial layers to the record as M describes a a dirty bastards putting wires in someone&amp;#39;s head which I think sets things up for the kind of dark narrative turn that follows on vampire in the corner which has one of the cutest chord and Melody combos on the entire record I also love hearing M&amp;#39;s voice in this much more hushed intimate setting her vocals are so quiet but so sweet and expressive too and the whole song kind of describes a desire for love in a sense but also kind of feeling too weird and offputting and and maybe too into the love that you&amp;#39;re interested in uh to actually achieve it there&amp;#39;s a want there&amp;#39;s a need there but simultaneously there&amp;#39;s also this disorienting blockage in the way that is difficult to describe and the whole track comes to this really huge confusing and almost abrasive Crescendo of sounds it kind of sounds like um hearing 200 Kazo going off at once it&amp;#39;s an absolutely insane display of layers for sure following this watching TV I&amp;#39;m just a bit torn on though as I think the progressive ever Chang ing structure of the track keeps very little of what goes on in the first leg from sticking all that much however the ending Crescendo on the track is incredible does bring back those Prague Vibes in a big way and lyrically I do think this song is a great contrast from a lot of the bright and utopian imagery that is brought in the first leg of songs on the record as M says very directly on the song that it&amp;#39;s a time to meet the Monsters inside you and this track quickly Segways not just sonically but narratively too into the following tunnel vision which is this track that&amp;#39;s built on these very cute IND tronic beats and quaint synthesizer layers at least at the start anyway uh toward the end this is one of several tracks on the record that like I said earlier uh kind of launches off into this Prague Rock epic with a lot of layers of disorienting synthetic and organic noise it&amp;#39;s a really insane and cinematic display really like something out of a horror movie meanwhile lyrically uh we have a lot of the themes of the previous song being reinforced where kind of describes on some level uh being afraid of recognizing and seeing her actual self where you actually witness uh your imperfections your shortcomings your demons which manifests in lyrics like I&amp;#39;ve learned what made me start what turned me on now I&amp;#39;m scared of all my parts cuz suddenly I can see everything wrong then I get tunnel vision closing in over me from here though I think we come to some kind of like Peak or Revelation in the track list on love is everywhere this very bright Feelgood string kissed piece of funk which when you get down to it seems to very much be about uh love being there and being present as long as you are willing to accept it I also want to quickly add here that some fans May recognize the instrumental on this track as having a lot in common with uh that of little yachties running out of time one of the tracks from you know his experimental Rock and psychedelic pop album and that&amp;#39;s because Matthew and Ma actually have production credits on that track seemingly uh the Beats on these two songs are pretty much the same and I guess what happened is they must have just allowed Lil yachty to uh maybe dig through the Vault or just offered some production that they had lying around to him but then I I guess sort of you know later intended to reuse it themselves for a different song in a different context so either way uh the similarity is there and just thought it was interesting thing to bring up after this we have the feeling dis inserted interlude or disconcerted which uh yeah I would say is a pretty accurate description of the majority of emotions that fuel the songs on this album the uh unsettling Vibes the confusion but it&amp;#39;s a beautiful confusion though I would say especially in the final leg of the album where I think uh mag Bay dishes out some of the strongest material on the album as we have some fantastic fuzzed out crispy acid washed Funk pop on that&amp;#39;s my floor which has some insane transcendental imagery of a hotel an elevator a fire a party it&amp;#39;s uh really an interesting puzzle to kind of put together narratively then this makes quite the transition into cry for me which is a cynthy soaring cinematic piece of disco that is obviously very Abba inspired but if you could make their material sound uh a little bit more smooth and Intergalactic while still keeping some of that theatrical Camp especially with the character plot on this one then in a way a lot of the major themes of the album come to a head on the stunningly beautiful angel on a satellite where the soaring strings and disco grooves return once again but only after some very contemplative pianos and intimate vocals from M uh that dive in once again to this idea around learning to love learning to accept love learning to see and experience the world and yourself through a person you love which of course leads to lyrics like cuz when I see me through your eyes I love me so don&amp;#39;t leave my side you always see the Sky Angel on a satellite then the closing track kind of diverges from a lot of the main narratives on the album uh for kind of an epilogue and credits roll type moment it&amp;#39;s this cute little Ode To The Duo Journey as a a music group and it&amp;#39;s super fun with all these Intergalactic little synth layers and this absolutely insane like buildup moment where it seems like the track is really going to pop off but then hits a crescendo with all these vocal layers but the tempo slows down so it kind of busts into this weird slow-mo moment which is just one of many weird Progressive experimental but dazzling uh elements of the track but yeah overall I would say that like once again magdalina Bay has done it and have really outdone themselves as I do genuinely think that this record uh for anybody who gives it the actual time of day uh will see it as one of the best experiences they&amp;#39;ll have with a pop record in 2024 again the lyrics are thoughtful the songs are Snappy the production is very high grade high quality High detail you have a lot of Concepts and recurring themes throughout the record narratively and sonically that uh makes the entire thing kind of like an onion you can keep pulling back layers on every time you listen to it there are a couple of tracks whose progressions I found to be just a wee bit tedious but that&amp;#39;s about it maybe there are some spots where I think the various themes and narratives throughout the record could have been spelled out a little bit better or linked a bit more Clos closely or creatively but those are like very minor criticisms at the end of the day I feel like the flow of this record is excellent the performances are fantastic too the mixes are great as well I just don&amp;#39;t really have a lot to tear this album up over it&amp;#39;s just like a great pop record a great creative amazing little pop record which is why I&amp;#39;m feeling a light to decent n on it TR position have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should I review next hit the like if you like Please Subscribe and please don&amp;#39;t cry hit the Bell as well over here

    "transcript": "hey everyone metal and coffee here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest metal music nerd and today we&amp;#39;re going to be reviewing Al&amp;#39;s seven studio album called cutting the throat of God wa hey who are you you don&amp;#39;t remember me you called me metal mommy last time I don&amp;#39;t know doesn&amp;#39;t sound like something I&amp;#39;d say plus you look more like an alternative Aunt than a metal mommy maybe you should change your sweater for once okay fine I know when I&amp;#39;m not wanted well with that out of the way alterate came across my radar and 2020 when they released their last record the band got their start in 2000 originally named as blood wreath but changing their name in 2002 there are a trio from New Zealand that tend to be labeled as death metal but is that really accurate you can definitely hear not only death metal but also black metal and post-metal influences especially in their latest work in their earlier years they were releasing high energy aggressive Tech death which is something you can easily hear in their second f everything is fire but even then they had a knack for completely drowning you in constant chaotic blast beats and just being super super black metalesque as you progress further in their discography though you can hear them start to embrace creating Melancholy and space in their music with their last release stare into death and be still which is their six studio album the band marks this as their decision to start moving away from being a band rooted in entirely in dissonance they are now making a conscious effort to just be all about Melody and power I find it really interesting that this is where I chose to hop on board with them because their darkwave almost Gothic sounding Melodies are what made me gravitate towards them in the first place but not even just that the records themes of grief and demise had a significant impact on me it might be weird to say but I find a lot of comfort in the artistic expression of sadness and general vulnerability I think that&amp;#39;s why I gravitate towards bands like antha 40 watt Sun Cult of Luna Catatonia I just find it really refreshing and relatable and now with their new record cutting the throat of God the band continues to explore quote unquote the most fundamental aspect of all Life Death the band excels at crafting a hollowed and disturbing atmosphere almost as if capturing the inner dialogue of existential dread and turmoil for instance in the album opener the flow through Ashen Hearts it immediately sets you up in this bitterly cold climate with its dark wav sounding riffs and haunting vocals the drum work is MVP though I feel like that&amp;#39;s been the case for their past couple records it&amp;#39;s what brings that black metal element to them and it&amp;#39;s kind of scary how commanding of your intention it is the Don is hollow is a perfect example of this it creates this Dreadful atmosphere contrasted by clean guitar Melodies and a brooding Baseline that basically serves as a Sinister Cal amongst the chaos this track with its focus on the meaninglessness of existence is a favorite of mine for its technicality and unexpected turns Transfiguration in and out of Worlds is another favorite of mine because it seems to be more straightforward death metal with their own little Twist on it of course it features a Moody and ominous Groove with a simple yet impactful guitar riff creating this sort of comforting yet gloomy Ambience throughout the record alcat ability to turn kof on and off at just the right moments is what keeps me so engaged whether it be through dissonant soundscapes or minimalistic and brooding riffs their lyrics like in the track the flow through Ashen hearts with lines like quote unquote these Wicked and tortured dreams intertwined with the real until becoming the real just further enhances the album&amp;#39;s Grim themes and just makes it a profoundly impactful listening experience the title track cutting the throat of God is a powerful closer that details out how you&amp;#39;ve reached your final moments and how all that repenting was for nothing the initial flow of the record is reflective and pensive in a sense that you are being forced to face the terrorizing reality that you are just Immortal this is similar to the feelings I felt on the previous record which is what sold me Midway through the record the aggression and confrontation pick up with lyrics like alive to exist awake to expire and that&amp;#39;s from Transfiguration in and out of Worlds I can&amp;#39;t be the only one who has a very bodily viseral reaction to a lyric like that it literally stresses me out to think about it and fortunately or unfortunately this is a repeating battle throughout the record and it&amp;#39;s one of the many reasons why I love this record and this band while this record has many strengths there are a few areas where it falls short for example in the track further opening the wounds it struggles to maintain engagement in the first half which makes it somewhat forgettable at some points despite the band&amp;#39;s intention to create this discomfort it does start to blur again a little bit losing its distinctiveness the track does redeem itself though with this moment of painful resolve and invigorating grooves to see death just once is another track that kind of loses its form a little bit but once again it does redeem itself so ultimately it wasn&amp;#39;t that bothersome the track is dynamic enough though and even has moments of really aggressive guitar picking that jolt my attention back these are the only two track facts that suffer from this kind of blurry gray area maybe there&amp;#39;s just too much going on technically for my taste or maybe I&amp;#39;m just a fan girl for the dark Sinister and slow sections of their music but either way that intense repetition and lack of Distinction makes those parts of the music less impactful and less memorable overall uler right&amp;#39;s latest album shows their incredible musicianship and their adeptness at creating a cohesively grim listening experience the band&amp;#39;s ability to weave intricate dissonant sounds with dark almost ugly sounding Melodies and I mean ugly in the best way possible is evident throughout the record as I said before the album attempts to understand the concept of death but at the same time accepts that one is hopeless against it the only drawbacks on the album were moments where everything felt too Blended together but those moments were redeemed pretty quickly in comparison to other records I don&amp;#39;t think I can honestly compare it to anything outside of their previous record because as I mentioned before stare into death and be still marked a new chapter for the band not to say that their earlier work is not worth checking out because it absolutely is especially if you love non-stop aggression and intensity but if you are open to the idea of experimentation and self-reflection in a facing your demons kind of way I highly recommend these past two records now cutting the throat of God in comparison to stare into death and be still and keeping in mind that both are about death I&amp;#39;d say ulcerate elevated their ability to convey this really really Grim atmosphere in the newest one The Still Moments throughout cutting the throat of God kind of hit you in the soul a a little bit more it&amp;#39;s a little sharper and I feel like it invokes a lot more rage and emotion something that I didn&amp;#39;t quite get with stare into death and be still I can only see them continuing to get better at their ability to sink you into their misery and despair in the end cutting the throat of God is very powerful and it shows ulcerate continuing to pave their own way pave their own sound in the death metal black metal post metal the everything metal realm with that said I&amp;#39;m feeling a light n transition how would you rate it how would you rate it did you love it did you hate it thanks so much to Anthony for having me again and I will see you next time metal hits"

White&amp;#39;s a singer and a songwriter and a producer the man over at Third Man Records he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s a modern rock legend a guitarist extraordinaire who I am not reviewing in this video yeah he&amp;#39;s back or which I don&amp;#39;t know and I&amp;#39;m not aware of maybe I would be if I were viewing him in this video but I&amp;#39;m not but you know since his career began to take off in the 2000s as one half of the White Stripes he has been a very busy bee always creating collaborating building the Jack White and Third Man Records brand the man has truly accomplished more in 20 years than some artist and bands do in twice that time with twice the album and despite all that commercial success he continues to be an artist who does things on his own terms especially in this current Act of his career with his last couple of releases the extremely experimental and sometimes absurd boarding housee reach for one as well as the one two punch of albums he put out uh back in 2022 the record of low-key sometimes acoustic ballads as well as high Distortion garage Rock ragers that were on fear of the Dawn and entering Heaven alive and this new record over here which I am not reviewing no absolutely not no review no name not even a proper label on this thing I mean it&amp;#39;s white it&amp;#39;s white it&amp;#39;s completely white it&amp;#39;s even it&amp;#39;s even like white over here it&amp;#39;s totally it&amp;#39;s totally blank what is there even to talk about but yeah this new record over here is essentially another surprise up Jack sleeve because he&amp;#39;s the goddamn willly wonk of Music at this point this no-name record was released without much in the way of any te any Fan Fair no big single no what you could say is a proper album roll out and I first caught wind of it through people who are Jack White fans telling me uh that it was being sold exclusively at the third man record store vinyl only but now the entire thing is finally out on streaming and in my hand and it&amp;#39;s kind of funny that this record was rolled out in the way that it is because aesthetically speaking I feel like it&amp;#39;s exactly the sort of thing that Jack White&amp;#39;s U difficult to please fans have been begging him to do for years just give us some raw organic ballsy blues and garage rock with loud guitars loud drums a lot of Simplicity very blunt very direct uh just like in the wildest days of the White Stripes like first album era White Stripes but then add to it the Finesse and knack for songwriting and guitar tone Wizardry uh that Jack White picked up on and and just got a better grasp of late in his career and in concept uh this sort of thing for a fan of Jack&amp;#39;s Music regardless of the era uh almost sounds like too good to be true because really how many artists have tried to recapture uh an older uh maybe more artistically revered era of their career only for their attempts to do so uh to kind of fall flat on their face just leading to mostly awkward results that uh pale in comparison to what they&amp;#39;re attempting to do but in the case of noname here it it&amp;#39;s really actually no we have 13 blazing tracks on this thing that are all just Relentless catchy and fun screaming riffs big drum beats from Patrick Keeler of Afghan wigs and of course rakan tour Fame it&amp;#39;s very no mus no fuss guitars drums vocals with a bit of layers coming in the form of uh maybe a few Keys guitar solos some embell ments and vocal harmonies but even with those details uh the mixes on this record are pretty aggressive they&amp;#39;re pretty distorted not high gloss not super clean nothing like that and it doesn&amp;#39;t have any of that extra stuff that you might uh have gotten out of some of Jack&amp;#39;s more cleanly or ambitiously produced projects over the years because it it doesn&amp;#39;t really need any of that stuff and we&amp;#39;re not getting a whole lot of wild genre experiments on this thing either it really truly is Jack Going Back to Basics and and sounding amazing in the process I mean the opening track alone makes it pretty clear what he is going to be going for on this record lots of blaring blues and garage guitar licks and riffs with Jack&amp;#39;s voice sounding absolutely vicious on top of them delivering lyrics that might actually be dealing in his tendency to go against the music industry grain like I was talking about earlier as there are mentions on this track of uh being owned being dethroned selling out uh a percentage of the profit being taken it is a hard as Nails start uh to this LP that somehow gets even harder on the following track bless yourself which kind of ties into another major theme of this album and that is God and spirituality the drums and guitar riffs on this track get even heavier and chunkier with Jack&amp;#39;s words getting louder too talking about if if God&amp;#39;s busy uh you might as well bless yourself also further into the track too saying if you&amp;#39;re a cop uh arrest yourself I guess even if Jack&amp;#39;s album covers are blue he&amp;#39;s not backing the blue there&amp;#39;s also a sick bridge on this track too that not only has a really distinct Melody to it in contrast to the entire track uh but he&amp;#39;s kind of going through these vocal passages that are ranting and he&amp;#39;s almost like undercutting the premise of his own points on the track in a way that seems kind of like a big put on it&amp;#39;s highly entertaining following this that&amp;#39;s how I&amp;#39;m feeling is another garage Rock Revival rager with steady quirky verses one of which has these funny little phone dial tone sound effects going on in the background uh given Jack&amp;#39;s lyrics at the time and yeah these verse bits kick off into some of the loudest choruses on the entire record the loud soft Dynamic uh is pulled off perfectly with this track and then the record suddenly gets a little bit dramatic on the following it&amp;#39;s rough on rats which I mean comparatively is is not that much more theatrical than everything else here I mean the raw kickass performances are still really what sells the track and are the main priority but still it does provide a bit of Versatility with Jack really kind of yucking it up on the vocal end and singing about the uh further deterioration of the state of the world and how if it&amp;#39;s rough on people at the very bottom of the food chain it must be roughest on the rats a lot of the religious themes come back on the track Archbishop Harold Holmes or at least I would bring that up if I was reviewing this album which I&amp;#39;m not no this is not a review so I&amp;#39;m not going to comment on the Searing garage riffs on this track and the way that Jack kind of madly Rambles over them like he&amp;#39;s some kind of religious zealot maybe I have an opinion on that of some sort if you you&amp;#39;ll never know though or maybe you will because it it does feel a bit like a late era White Stripes kind of track and how you know kind of narrative and Theatrical it&amp;#39;s trying to be it does drag on a bit but it&amp;#39;s still not you know uh super hokey or anything like that uh the riffs the beats the aggression of it all that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s really what kind of still takes priority following this we have pure lowii garage Punk Mayhem on bombing out what&amp;#39;s the rumpus sees Jack one more time plugging back into the music industry commentary a bit but instrumentally speaking he is really plugging into something here that very kind of pure simple anthemic loud aggressive Rock magic that made tracks like Seven Nation Army as good as they are especially with those big anthemic O O&amp;#39;s on the bridge these super simple but sticky guitar leads at the start Jack continues to be on fire in this track list on tonight was a long time ago he&amp;#39;s just seemingly frakin Unstoppable with these riffs and choruses they&amp;#39;re just going off I I don&amp;#39;t know why is he making an album like this now of all times just to sort of like prove he can still do it like screw you guys here&amp;#39;s like my random no tile album that uh some among you have been begging for for years and I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m just going to do it just to show you look I haven&amp;#39;t lost it look at me look at me I don&amp;#39;t know either way it&amp;#39;s working the really awesome bold and uh instantaneously catchy weird slide blues guitar Melodies on underground are also a major highlight meanwhile number one with a bullet sounds kind of like if you took early 200s White Stripes but had them write a Death from Above 1979 song and it was awesome because again this record really does feel like it&amp;#39;s throwing it back to that uh super minimal Duo era uh of of rudimentary underground rock and it&amp;#39;s just doing it so good it&amp;#39;s doing it so good we&amp;#39;ve been missing this and Jack still keeps just delivering great tracks on the back end of this thing missionary being another one of them which I think it writing wise is one of the most raw unhinged and suggestive songs he&amp;#39;s ever released I mean yeah the song is very much about what it&amp;#39;s clearly about you know you&amp;#39;re going to miss me it&amp;#39;s again it&amp;#39;s very suggestive with Jack throwing in bits of manic laughter in the middle of his lyrics laughing like a psycho I&amp;#39;m going to grow on you like an apple seed I&amp;#39;m everything that you need Jack you&amp;#39;re a Madman he also goes on later into the track to admit he&amp;#39;s an affection addict Jack White what a hoe we also have a very moody but fitting closer on the record as well that I think goes over great yeah I mean outside of a couple tracks paling in comparison to others and you know Archbishop uh dragon a little bit I feel like this is a stellar album from Jack like uh he he&amp;#39;s not Rand venting the wheel and uh you know uh for sure a lot of fans are are going to look at this and and probably not be maybe as impressed with it uh because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s going to feel like Old School White Stripes which due to various biases and nostalgia in in their minds it may not hold a candle to but in terms of just raw performance uh simple but effective writing um you know fiery and explosive mixes um on in everything you need and nothing you don&amp;#39;t type Rock album that is backed with Attitude uh no name really does like kind of give you everything that you could possibly want I mean if this was a review which it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s very much not a review no no review here um I could see myself to maybe you know saying this album&amp;#39;s like a a decent nine like to decent nine um but you know because this is not a review I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m able to do that the world is just going to have to live without knowing the truth about how I feel about this album because this is not not reviewing it it&amp;#39;s not a review nope not doing it so there

    "transcript": "hi everyone big thiny feels Tano here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new Beth Gibbons album lives outgrown UK vocalist and songwriter Miss Beth Gibbons her new one here is one of my most anticipated albums of the year not simply because the singles in the leadup to this album were pretty fire but also new music from Beth is just such a rare treat the group that Beth broke out with years and years and years ago por his head was able to uh make some genre defining music in the lane of trip hop on only a couple records outside of that extracurriculars for Beth musically speaking have been pretty few and far between I mean her PES head counterpart Jeff Barrow is always prolifically tinkering on something be that a new uh Quakers or beak project doing a soundtrack meanwhile Beth&amp;#39;s last major soloish album dropped over 20 years ago which was a beautiful collab with talk talks Paul web under the Rustin man name it&amp;#39;s also worth mentioning the couple of surprising but impressive guest vocal feature performances Beth has given over the years like on JJ Doom the final MF Doom collab before he passed away or Kendrick Lamar&amp;#39;s Mr morale and the big steppers and now we suddenly have this new full length LP featuring production from versatile Studio wizard James Ford as well as Lee Harris of talk talk Fame and it&amp;#39;s hard to prepare you for what this album has in store because there is just so little to compare it to in Beth&amp;#39;s discography sure I could say the instrumental pallets are similarly dense and a little orchestral in the way that they were on the uh surprise 2019 live performance that Beth dropped in tandem with the Polish national radio Symphony Orchestra but I think the similarities kind of end there the tone of lives outgrown is far more forlorn and mournful than anything Beth has done previously the mood truly is dismal with a capital D in a way that reminds me frankly of a lot of late era records from singers and songwriters that have proven track records of writing some pretty dark stuff be that Leonard Cohen with you want it darker or some of the stuff PJ Harvey or Nick Cave have put out over the past 10 years as throughout this album here there are themes reflecting on mortality time passing the way various aspects of love and life change over time in a way it kind of makes sense that this record was written and assembled over a period of 10 years cuz over this period of time I imagine Beth and many in her life were undergoing some pretty major life changes the track loss changes for example is all about a love that you once knew to be much more intense than it is now uh it just sort of progressively growing more and more dull over time and you so desperately want that to change back I should also mention the chord changes the Spacey production the relax grooves the acoustic guitar tones are all very floian and there&amp;#39;s an eeriness to the performance and melodies on the track as well which is not a surprise given uh that&amp;#39;s an itch that Beth has pretty consistently scratched whether it be PTO head stuff or solo stuff as a point of comparison what&amp;#39;s missing now are some of the jazzier undertones on out of season uh which I was referencing earlier for example and and those have been kind of swapped out instead for rhythm sections and instrumental progressions that are a lot more meditative entrancing and low-key Sinister the song rewind very much fit that bill with its mystical strings and wailing crunchy guitars and vocal delays I can also feel the fear in Beth&amp;#39;s voice as she&amp;#39;s singing about uh time passing in such a way to where she can&amp;#39;t stop it it&amp;#39;s giving her this sense of dread and she has gone so far that she can&amp;#39;t go back you can&amp;#39;t rewind so repetition instrumental growth along a linear track as well as Sonic Immersion I would say these are pretty consistent characteristics across the record no matter what song you&amp;#39;re listening to but there are some tracks that definitely pop off harder than others be that through standout choruses profoundly deep levels of sadness or showy displays of instrumentation like with the booming drums and huge horn sections firing off throughout much of reaching out which is really one of the most powerful Peaks on the record let me also mention beyond the sun which features these pounding Primal drums across the track also droning crescendos of strings and leads and these big group chorus vocals a chaotic sack solo as well it&amp;#39;s a track that is both vibrant but also pretty tortured meanwhile burden of life instrumentally may not be one of the loudest and most aggressive tracks here but the hook on this one is so shockingly Grim the burden of life just won&amp;#39;t leave us alone and the time&amp;#39;s never right when you&amp;#39;re trading the Sun the whole track feels like feudly running against a hamster wheel of time it&amp;#39;s a fight you can never win and these very bold and dissonant walls of strings that hit here and there just up the anti emotionally there are other tracks on the record that instrumentally and lyrically are lower intensity but uh still are very Fantastical there&amp;#39;s floating on a moment which was a great lead single to the record that has only grown on me with more listens first off I love the Eerie long sustaining vibh on this track which is just gorgeous but even more beautiful are the whisper quiet kids chorus vocals on the back end of the song which aren&amp;#39;t just there in my view as like a pretty feature because I do think they add to The Narrative of the album and the track in that there is this uh changing of time this loss of generations over years and years and years its age contrasted against youth there&amp;#39;s another interesting ju position on the closing track Whispering love where Beth&amp;#39;s very weary lead vocals make for an interesting fit against these gentle patient elegant layers of woodwind and guitar which sound very uh honestly youthful and kind of springy especially with those birds chirping toward the very end of the instrumental it&amp;#39;s very much giving the starting of a new cycle after all of this ponderance of loss of life loss of color loss of Vibrance and emotion and love but you have to go through that darkness before you see the light again which is uh where tracks like for sale come in which has these Plucky guitars and weepy strings in 34 the instrumental pallet feels like I&amp;#39;m listening to just a very dark folk tune from the Eastern block the song also features these chilling vocal harmonies that raise the emotional impact of the lyrics which is very much about mirages and dreams in life uh just not being real or uh kind of selling people on false hope the one track on the lp that wasn&amp;#39;t really doing all too much for me had to be the opener which is certainly melancholic and brings a heavy mood to the table but it&amp;#39;s really the only song where melodically the track is kind of Meandering and doesn&amp;#39;t make a bold statement in any direction outside of being underwhelmed a bit by the first track on the record I don&amp;#39;t really have a lot of criticisms and notes of this album It&amp;#39;s a truly gorgeous profoundly deep dark emotional High art type of Music Experience very much worth the weight worth the hype and just more absolute undeniable proof of Beth gibbons&amp;#39;s emotional perceptiveness her Artistry and really just everything that has made pretty much every record she has touched over the years uh Timeless to the 10th degree which is why I&amp;#39;m feeling a decent two strong nine on this one Tran position have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best

60s and70s classic rock into their own kaleidoscopic tapestry for almost a decade now over the years we&amp;#39;ve heard their growth with each new project whether it was the innocence of 2016&amp;#39;s due Hollywood the ambitious rock opera of 2018s go to school the bow Andes Glam Vibes of 2020 songs for the general public or the super beautiful 2023 everything Harmony a dream is all we know was the fifth full length of the New York Duo and honestly it&amp;#39;s the best album they&amp;#39;ve ever made not only is the production the most perfect balance of shimmering and crisp these songs are just so wonderfully constructed and cleverly arranged If the previous albums were the guys being in school this new album is them as the teacher and then once that school bell rings they jump out and jump into a 1969 VW bus cruise down the road as flowers grow all around them and a rainbow leads the way it&amp;#39;s ambitious it&amp;#39;s endearing it&amp;#39;s playful but more than anything it&amp;#39;s a rewarding listen opening track golden years and fights it in with its warm comforting Vibes lyrics about appreciating the present and having this premature Nostalgia for it but being super cool with that the bright jangly guitars and the soaring harmonies create this beautiful atmosphere as if you&amp;#39;re getting a letter from an old friend that you dearly Miss it&amp;#39;s the best possible song to open up the record with they don&amp;#39;t know how to fall in place follows this up and it&amp;#39;s just this Groovy Little Shaker of a song it sounds like four songs rolled into one I absolutely love that Dynamic vocal interplay that leads into this sunny bright chorus it&amp;#39;s a song about figuring out your place in the world and there&amp;#39;s just enough Dynamics throughout this track to keep your ear glued to the speaker it&amp;#39;s absolutely a song the small faces would have loved to have written church bells comes up next and it&amp;#39;s straight out of the ray Davy song book and I am all here for it this thing is it&amp;#39;s cheery it&amp;#39;s got these great singalong moments uh it&amp;#39;s storytelling about a little town and the the people you encounter and the feelings you have throughout your day the horns that close this track out are just this nice little Baroque touch that just lands so perfectly it&amp;#39;s the it&amp;#39;s the cherry on top of this beautiful slice of 60 psychedelic pie up next is the modern classic and a play on the title A dream is all I know and dreams really show you kind of where you&amp;#39;re going and where you&amp;#39;ve been and what you what you&amp;#39;re doing during the day and you learn a lot from your dreams and this song sounds like a mission statement it sounds like look there&amp;#39;s no option two like there&amp;#39;s no plan B like there&amp;#39;s no we don&amp;#39;t see what happens like I&amp;#39;ve got a course in my mind this is where I&amp;#39;m going I&amp;#39;m dreaming about it a dream is all I know this is what I&amp;#39;m going to do this is what I&amp;#39;m going to make happen musically this track is gorgeous it&amp;#39;s Spacey it&amp;#39;s confident the glowing harm monies the crunchy guitars the shuffling drums a truly awesome song we take a totally different Direction with the next track sweet vibration with its Good Day Sunshine es piano um would definitely fit very comfortably on side to of revolver and it sounds kind of like if the Left Bank were making revolver songs like they were really into Paul McCartney and they were like you know what let&amp;#39;s use our Baroque popes feel and write Paul McCartney songs and I&amp;#39;m all here for it in the eyes of the girl is such a great track it&amp;#39;s the closest they&amp;#39;ve ever come to signing like 19 64 Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys they nail it the Lush harmonies the gentle delivery the pacing the storytelling it&amp;#39;s all there you get cord combinations that Beach Boys would have used back in the&amp;#39; 60s which can be pretty tricky to pull off but the guys nail it if you and I are not wise follows that up with its Birds jangly guitars dripping all over it those clean tight-knit lead vocals the gentle pacing everything about this just takes its time to be delivered which musically makes a lot of sense cuz it works so well with the lyrics a song about growing a relationship and establishing it you know developing safety and understanding the other person and looking out for them and validating them probably my favorite song The Lemon Twigs have ever put out how can I love her more is just like the most dynamic mixed bag of 60s tricks you can ever hope to hear one song the changes the bounciness the Cheery optimism the smiles in their voices the construction of this track and its presentation gives us the best of 60 Sunshine pop anywhere between like Gary Lewis and the Playboys or the Association obviously mixed in with the Beach Boys and the Beatles and it&amp;#39;s a wonderful song about expressing your love for someone and realizing that like no matter how much you give you just can&amp;#39;t give enough Ember days comes in next like a nice cool Autumn Breeze at night um this song sounds like a lost track from SF sorrow you know the the vocals are delicate this the storytelling is nostalgic it&amp;#39;s a nice comfy quiet kind of song peppermint roses follows that up and this thing is a total straight up 60s rocker well performed harmonies dance on top of this crunchy rocker there&amp;#39;s excellent tambourine moments splotchy drums great synth Parts a song about wanting the past to return because when things were better they were minty fresh and they were pretty to look at I should have known right from the start comes up next and this has a bit of a Steven Still&amp;#39;s Neil Young kind of guitar picking feel a really tasty walking Baseline and lyrically it&amp;#39;s a song about the past being you know hindsight what it is it&amp;#39;s 2020 sometimes we need to fall before we walk closing track rock on over and over just incorporates every bit of glamrock just shoved into a a great tight little because in the end it&amp;#39;s only rock and roll but it&amp;#39;s a song about going on determination just keep plugging forward just keep rocking on man um the the piano the hand claps the splotchy drums it just creates this epic smoothie of glamrock goodness and it goes down smooth man overall the lemon Twigs picked the perfect name for this record follow your dreams pursue them believe in them because sometimes if that&amp;#39;s all you have if you&amp;#39;re broke if you got nothing left you can still dream you can always dream we learned so much about our elves and where we&amp;#39;re going in our dreams and if we listen closely and attentively enough we can really get an idea of what&amp;#39;s to come the fans believe in the dream just as much as the lemon Twigs do and maybe that&amp;#39;s the whole point I feel like this album is a dream a dream is all we know is that beautiful moment where you&amp;#39;re kind of awake kind of asleep but ultimately happy it&amp;#39;s a beautiful place full of colorful imagery heartfelt storytelling and expertly delivered performances truly something the lemon twig should be very proud of I&amp;#39;m feeling a strong nine on this one transition have you given this album alisten did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should buy or review next hit the like if you like Please Subscribe and please don&amp;#39;t cry hit the Bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you could check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony fantano lemon Twigs forever"

    "transcript": "hi everyone G tan here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new knocked loose album you won&amp;#39;t go before you&amp;#39;re supposed to here we have the third fulllength studio album from this metal core and hardcore act knocked loose a respectably Heavy band from Louisville Kentucky uh that has been at it for over a decade now and while there are two previous records up until this point C kicked ass I wouldn&amp;#39;t say either of them brought a sound that was specific enough to where they stood out in the very uh dense and saturated world of metal core however on their 2021 EP a tear in the fabric of Life the band did begin to get more creative with tension grooves uh sounds and sound effects that they surrounded their pummeling breakdowns with and also on this new album here they continue mining for creative ways to make their skull crushing strain of metal core uh that much more nuanced and colorful which is a good thing finer details generally are nice but simultaneously on this record knock loose is very clearly fully engaged in the broad Global loud Rock arms race to generate the most blaring and punishing sound possible on an album and right now with this record I would say it is knocked loose that is pulling out to the the front now being real I&amp;#39;m a New England boy I&amp;#39;ve heard my fair share of metal core over the years and I truly believe this record here is honestly pushing the envelope for the genre a little bit which is pretty surprising because I didn&amp;#39;t think anything was ever really going to top something like a Kurt Belo production I mean no shade to the guy obviously he&amp;#39;s partially responsible for some of my favorite albums of all time but the thickness and base and Clarity on this loose record is just incredible doing part to producer and songwriter Drew Fulk who got his start with metal core bands such as motionless and white but over the years he&amp;#39;s done his fair share of stuff uh for a lot of rap artists too and I can honestly see how all of that is coalescing on this album cuz again the low end in the mixes on this thing are incredible and the attention to detail on the editing side too to make sure every drum hit and every chug uh in the guitars on the breakdown like it just hits with Maximum Impact making sure at times there&amp;#39;s these tiny moments of Silence in between the riffs so you&amp;#39;re getting that uh complete Spectrum uh from the quietest moments of the record to the loudest but yeah even though in many ways this record is assembled pretty methodically it still grooves very organically overproduced or overworked or not terms I would use to describe this record at all and on top of that knock loose is going the extra mile on these tracks to experiment more with different grooves sound effects Eerie little sounds and guitar parts to uh just make their breakdowns and make their Transitions and their buildups uh that much more harrowing and Eerie bringing more depth to these explosive and aggressive tracks a more meat and potatoes metal core album of this style would have been a lot more forgettable but instead the blistering intro on this record uh kicks off with some Eerie Ambience blast Beats layers of feedback to and after all of that is when we start getting the crow Magnum riffs with lyrics describing never ending Primal desire uh for Comfort uh that is never quite satisfied uh being driven mad by this desire to a degree and while it&amp;#39;s not the catchiest song in the record it certainly sets the tone uh very well in terms of the narratives to follow and just uh the volume and intensity that we&amp;#39;re going to be experiencing for uh most of this thing then on the following piece by piece we are in full break down mode we really catch the full range and punch of the drums with them playing at a reasonable Pace the sustain on that snare is massive when it gets whacked you really hear it like ring out for a bit it sounds like an industrial oil drum being beaten to pieces with a pool queue the guitars uh sound like heavy machinery uh being crushed by a chorus of hydraulic presses meanwhile frontman Brian garrus&amp;#39;s vocals are uh just Relentless throat shredding screams that are done in this kind of higher register a very nasly tamber 2 not concerned at all in delivering in more of a a deep and guttural style which honestly I think makes his lyrics more intelligible and his performances a lot more animalistic and varied the pain I swallowed has been stuck at my throat the way he delivers his screams makes for a nice contrast with the background vocals too anyway and from here the band expands the Sonic pallet of the record a little bit with guest vocalist poppy on suffocate whose input brings a lot to the record especially during that creepy little spoken word passage where she really manages to sear the lyrics of the track in my head and that&amp;#39;s not even the catchiest part because from here we have these Sinister dissonant uh little guitar bits that sound like they&amp;#39;re straight out of a horror movie trailer and in the final breakdown of the song uh the drummer kind of switches it up into a regga tone Groove we&amp;#39;re all of a sudden getting a but in like a metal core context and works the seething bitterness and hatred and need for separation of expressed in the lyrics on this track is reinforced on the following don&amp;#39;t reach for me whose opening bar stuck with me quite a bit I dream of a cleansing wave reborn don&amp;#39;t reach for me no lies can spread from a tongue removed and I love the way these lyrics expand even further over these doomy and Eerie heavier guitar passages later into the track then again once more after this uh kind of stripped back breakdown passage the progression of the track is great there is a push and pull to each section tension and release which the band is so skilled at pulling off at this point it&amp;#39;s really an essential uh part of this record because it keeps the songs from getting stale despite many of them being so loud from front to back so relentless and it&amp;#39;s now that I would like to point out that it&amp;#39;s not just the flow of these tracks that is great but the album overall because it&amp;#39;s varied enough to where it feels like I&amp;#39;m not just listening to uh one single sound or song or idea play out again and again and again but it moves so tightly from track to track from moment to moment it&amp;#39;s as if I&amp;#39;m not experiencing an album of single songs or anything like that it&amp;#39;s like some kind of metal core beat down hardcore Suite with various movements all working in Tandem and the middle section comes together especially well with the way the finish of don&amp;#39;t reach for me uh has this break neck transition into the much faster Moss covers all and then the way the Eerie little guitar arpeggio that finishes that track off uh transitions into take me home which ends off with this slowly intensifying anxiety inducing a wall of screaming guitars and feedback and the final moments of this record in my opinion keep things interesting too the chemistry between Brian and Chris Motionless on slaughterhouse 2 uh definitely turns up the heat on the vocal end there are some ghoulish oozing drippy dissonant string bits laced into the guitars on the back end too kind kind of feels like the band is veering into a dark almost Gothic kind of Blasphemous metal Direction than just straight up metal core which is kind of confirmed on the calm that keeps you awake where some of the chromatic guitar bits the leads and the Cookie Monster style death growls uh feel like they are really kind of making a a bit of a death core nod here but doing it in a super tasteful way that fits in snugly with the rest of the lp lyrically blinding Faith really kind of seals the deal with the records bone to pick uh with religion and spirituality communicating internal fears of not really feeling in touch with the spirit as it were and not knowing what exactly that means but simultaneously attacking the idea of Blind Faith and comparing it to just allowing yourself to be controlled with the closing track on the lp the band really saves some of the slowest and heaviest and most dramatic moments for last the whole thing really does sound like a movie soundtrack once again and uh the riffs that end the record really feel like a dismal March into Oblivion and and while I do think there are some finer details that are just so loud so fast and so aggressive they kind of fly by you whether you want them to or not I still walked away from this record massively impressed with uh how it was engineered compositionally sonically and even conceptually as the sound of this record again in my opinion uh by metal core standards especially is just incredible not only are the details and the balance there but in terms of thickness intensity and heaviness this is just like the next step for the genre then in terms of the narrative you may or may not take personal issue with uh this album&amp;#39;s uh personal perception and opinion on religion and Faith but there is a lyrical consistency and focus that I can&amp;#39;t deny and at least the band is trying to uh put some pretty poetic lyrics to these themes and tropes uh around blasphemy and just a lack of faith and a lack of belief and also putting out there some sensible and understandable feelings around how destructive it can be to force yourself into feeling something or willing yourself to something when your heart&amp;#39;s not really in it then there&amp;#39;s just the writing and performance side which the guitar work the riffs the drumming the vocals they&amp;#39;re all bold they all hit hard they all contribute to incredibly memorable moments across the entirety of the album no one part of it feels like it&amp;#39;s falling massively short or anything like that and while it may have been cooler to hear some more Dynamics and variation across the LP 27 minutes is also kind of a very ideal length for this sort of thing so that it doesn&amp;#39;t overstay it&amp;#39;s welcome either so yeah that&amp;#39;s this incredible badass thoughtful boundary pushing album uh that I&amp;#39;m really impressed with um feeling a decent two strong nine on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should I review next hit the like if you like Please Subscribe and please don&amp;#39;t cry hit the Bell as well

for a review of this new Vampire Weekend only God was above us here we have the fifth full length LP from your favorite ivy league Blue Blood privilege as and aesthetic Indie pop Darlings Vampire Weekend a group that if you remember came in hot with that Cape Cod quasa quasa that multi- genre Multicultural multi-era Music Fusion uh in the late 2000s and they made some great records with it in the process Contra modern vampires of the city albums that were loaded with tons of catchy sweet Oddball tunes that went down smooth despite being based on a mindboggling combination of influences be that Jamaican SCA or Central African rhythms and guitar lines contemporary folk songwriters classical music hip hop of course Paul Simon big heaping helping of Paul Simon and the band Faithfully stuck to this catchy yet chaotic sound for over a decade but then went through a bit of an awkward transition with the departure of longtime member multi-instrumentalist and songwriter Ross he officially left the band in 2016 but has had a few production credits since including on this album and without rosom in the mix it became painfully clear just how key he was to the band&amp;#39;s versatile sound on their following record Father of the Bride it wasn&amp;#39;t a memorable album and it&amp;#39;s pretty definitively the Bottom Rung in what is overall a very tight and consistent discography from Vampire Weekend and while I didn&amp;#39;t think Ezra kanig and the boys would uh necessarily go back to their old sound on future releases I did go into this album hoping for some kind of bounceback and I&amp;#39;m happy to report on this album not only are we so back but only God was above us is truly a return to form in the best way there are 10 tracks on this thing cut clean just a just a straightforward 10 this track list is not messing around bringing Snappy sentimental Tunes LED vocally by of course Ezra&amp;#39;s uh very youthful boyish vocals fun production that brings back all of that uh crazy mixed instrumental palette mixed Fidelity Mayhem and the band once again is showcasing this wild mix of various genre nods Indian classical music congales guitar licks broke piano breaks and everything in between the opener ice cream piano eases us into things in instrumentally anyway with lots of lowii fuzzy bits of guitar and piano building up slowly in the background as Ezra&amp;#39;s words project images of War police authoritarianism and using this as a means to explore some kind of interpersonal conflict or maybe even an internal conflict with him singing about a singer who doesn&amp;#39;t sing or somebody who makes very bold statements nobody&amp;#39;s hearing because they&amp;#39;re being put quietly or maybe just not stated at all but the true selling point of this track for me is honestly the band chemistry cuz once this track picks up Vampire Weekend is rocking with the Galloping snares hammered pianos buzzing guitars there are some amazing string sections toward the end of the track too it is a complete and utter riot in the best way and the following track classical also Begins by firing on all cylinders pounding drum Loops lots of ride symbol which are topped with watery keyboard cords and some spicy searing guitar leads also as a bass player I love that upright bass that upright sounds so good on this entire album and I love how on this track and many others Vampire Weekend is able to assemble something that sounds so methodical yet also casually tossed together like those wild sacks and piano trades deeper into the track that kind of stuff doesn&amp;#39;t just happen by accident happen randomly but it is so explosive in its energy and performance it feels like lightning in a bottle things do calm down though and get a bit dreamier on the tracks to follow namely on the song Capricorn which I don&amp;#39;t think has the strongest core progression on the record but the Vibes are certainly there the mix hits with just the right amount of Reverb to uh make the guitars and everything sound a little dazzling and in fact I wouldn&amp;#39;t say Vampire Weekend is just simply looking to hand over a pretty slow burner on this track either because past the midpoint things get kind of experimental and harsh especially with these very brittle and kind of glitchy chord swells on the chorus and there&amp;#39;s also this uh little solo Bridge the song has that sounds kind of like either a guitar or a synthesizer being bent being stretched to the point where it&amp;#39;s screaming for Mercy it&amp;#39;s a beautiful racket that I feel like could uh really only come from Vampire Weekend At this point uh either that or it&amp;#39;s a little reminiscent of early Animal Collective moving on to the song connect though this track manages to be catchy through a series of very subtle instrumental moves like the slightly woozy and warped piano keys throughout the track that sound like they&amp;#39;re being uh played off of a a broken tape machine and then the lyrics on the track deal very much in a loss of personal or emotional connection and interest with lyrics like I know once it&amp;#39;s lost it&amp;#39;s never found the grid is buried in the ground and once again this is yet another track on the album where the Rhythm Section especially that upright base is sounding killer and really kind of like giving a nice strong tasteful flavorful backbone to the entire thing then with a prep school gangsters I&amp;#39;m not sure if any band other than Vampire Weekend could put out a song with such a title but uh this track as well finds a lot of power in Simplicity with some light Toms on the drums downum guitars meanwhile the lyrics on the track uh tie into a couple of different themes on the album namely the idea of a protagonist of facing some kind of Greater threat or powerful that they are smaller in comparison to the prep school gangsters U mentioned in uh the title of the song they&amp;#39;re not exactly the the heroes of this track it&amp;#39;s at this point though we&amp;#39;re at the halfway mark of the album and it&amp;#39;s in the second part of the lp that I think things get a little spotty the surfer is handily the sleepiest and blandest song on the album by a mile or two production wise there&amp;#39;s not a whole lot that stands out about the track it&amp;#39;s kind of washed out the instrumental pallet is very average in comparison with some of the other songs here there&amp;#39;s not a whole lot of uh cool or interesting breaks or transitions even the hook doesn&amp;#39;t really stand out and I think Ezra&amp;#39;s lyricism uh could use some work as well as some of the simile are a little basic and even a little redundant in tone or framing like this mention of broken bodybuilders or Runners losing races then there&amp;#39;s Gen X cops which I will admit did stun me as a single especially with these wild Punky kind of goth out lead guitars the performance is good but I feel like uh lyrically and narratively this song feels kind of redundant in uh the progression of the album that once I heard the entire thing I kind of got a sense of uh how conceptual and and uh heavy on the narrative side the uh story all of these songs cumulatively was telling but yeah there are other rockers on the album that also uh deal in cops deal in war deal in Conflict deal in authoritarianism to some degree and this track again also kind of brings a lot of these ideas up but doesn&amp;#39;t do it in a way where it feels like there&amp;#39;s any kind of further expounding on it no extra Revelations Mary Boon though is pure magic with its sparkling piano cords its head-nodding beats it&amp;#39;s cascading string layers and churchy frosted Coral vocals I mean this track is already a banger before we&amp;#39;ve even gotten into uh the lyrics which are uh very potent in their emotions of longing and yearning following this Pravda is one of my favorite tracks here by far this song helps also bring the story of the record to a conclusion because it is very much about uh leaving separating yourself from a person or situation with a lot of Illusions to Russian culture in uh some of the framing and some of the references with Pravda being the Russian word for truth and Ezra talking about taking the the family but yes he also sings about uh this person&amp;#39;s Consciousness uh whatever is Weighing on that not being his problem yeah he has very much had it with h whatever this Dynamic is that he&amp;#39;s dealing with and referencing in his songwriting and then with the closing track hope we have a bit of resolution with a very dissonant instrumental finish which is a uh kind of fitting and uh cathartic despite the fact that we&amp;#39;re uh leaving at a point uh where it doesn&amp;#39;t feel like things have completely fixed themselves because what Ezra is hoping for on this track is that despite the outcome the conflict whatever is going on here uh having some very bad results he kind of hopes that yeah everybody can just kind of move on get past it let it go and given the way the record has progressed up until this point I would say it&amp;#39;s probably the most fitting closer you could imagine I&amp;#39;ll say in comparison with uh some of vampire weekend&amp;#39;s back catalog I don&amp;#39;t know if uh the highest Highs are quite as high as my favorite moments off of Contra uh or even modern vampires per se but what I can say is that I think throughout this album uh the songwriting melodically lyrically is absolutely killer and on point in fact I love that most if not all of the songs across this album all kind of tie into a a series of experiences and points of view view that are very cohesive very focused because there are some very clear themes that Ezra is pulling from some personal experiences and putting into these songs and simultaneously he kind of frames a lot of it around uh these ideas of again police War authoritarianism stuff that I think um is a bit more observable and uh universally accepted and experienced in The Wider World by a lot of Vampire Weekend fans so it&amp;#39;s as if the album could sort of be experienced on a couple of different levels on top of this I will say as far as the production and instrumental qualities of this record go uh Vampire Weekend is sounding as creatively quirky as they ever have which is great and then I&amp;#39;ll say one more thing I feel like this album kind of breaks vampire weekend&amp;#39;s very awful very bad habit of uh in their track lists having at least one or two just painfully annoying unlistenable obnoxious songs that I us ually have to skip or just you know ignore their existence entirely and uh yeah this uh album is completely free of that in fact it is a very smart wellp put together LP uh that as far as I&amp;#39;m concerned is is just really uh no skips like the lowest moments on this album uh are listenable are a Vibe and the best moments are fantastically performed written produced so yeah absolutely fantastic and impressive record from Vampire weekend I&amp;#39;m feeling a light to decent nine on it in fact transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should I review next hit the like if you

    "transcript": "hi everyone up Theo Tano here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new cerous album maze Envy wowee Zoe that&amp;#39;s an incredible maze yeah it&amp;#39;s pretty cool I mean it&amp;#39;s amazazing uh for sure where do you even get a maze that good it&amp;#39;s just a drawing I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s real don&amp;#39;t you say that about Maisie we&amp;#39;re in love and she&amp;#39;s more real than you&amp;#39;ll ever be what and once I run through her walls we&amp;#39;ll see as maze Envy we&amp;#39;ll all see well that&amp;#39;s definitely not going to lead to anything later in this video this is the second fulllength LP from upand cominging California metal outfit cerus it&amp;#39;s their first for the 20 buuck spin label which drops loads of quality left field AR Grim underground metal records every year and I knew I was going to review this cerous album from the first teaser I heard Labyrinth charm featuring vocalist Derek rist of the faceless as well as the Zenith passage and this track was just some really great quality raw death metal with very good guitar work a crushingly heavy mix as well as some Progressive and dynamic elements at play too I&amp;#39;m talking oppressive Doom metal levels of heaviness on the riffs and the tuning I have not heard a death metal record quite this thick in a minute especially with the breakdown in the last leg of this track and while with this track I came for the heft I stayed for the mystical Eerie guitar arpeggios on the intro the very righteous and epic Rift passages toward the finish and the slightly black metal inspired midpoint that features some Relentless blast beats as well as very melodic tremolo guitar it&amp;#39;s a multiphase death metal track with a lot of great fluid tasteful changes that are memorable and actually complement each other as the band&amp;#39;s not just throwing blood and entrails at the wall to see what sticks or uh just overwhelm the audience so again given this track I had High Hopes going into this album but I just didn&amp;#39;t really know how ambitious and flavorful it would actually be when I heard the whole thing cuz the band really does land a perfect balance on this album between sounding powerful and massive but also leaving enough room in their details and mixes to bring in these extra cool little harmonious or melodic details and embellishments take the song shrouded in crystals for example which kicks off with these absolutely pounding riffs but then eventually we get these creepy horror film style synthesizers creeping into the song soaring above it all and adding some cinematic tension in the process which sets things up for the more Relentless riff pass Mees to follow now this track is an 8-minute monster so there is a lot to come after this Twisted cord changes really solid drum fills more soundtrack worthy synth layers and many nicely blocked out Rift passages that switch things up in intensity you&amp;#39;re getting mosh friendly ragers on here as well as more dizzying chromatic licks that uh really kind of hit you hard and leave you a little confused there&amp;#39;s a very Grand and doomy finale at the very end of the track and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just nice to hear a band of this style looking at a song of this length and really mapping it out to make sure it functions well on a macro level because for as long as the track is uh there&amp;#39;s just so much going on across it it doesn&amp;#39;t get stale and this could also be said for the album overall with its tight seven track runtime which includes an ominous spacious tone setting intro also the track endless symmetry which is a Serene and Bittersweet guitar passage that really sets things up well for the following track I mentioned earlier Labyrinth charm and deeper into the recordation tomb really ramps things up almost putting the two previous core tracks on the album to shame with its heaviness cuz those down tuned dissonant riff passages on the back end of the song are the hardest hitting thing on the record by far it&amp;#39;s just seismic earthquake levels of base and and still even at this level of of thick Ness of density we&amp;#39;re still getting these cool little extra melodic details and it serves as a great reminder that death Doom metal doesn&amp;#39;t need to be this tedious experience which is important for keeping things engaging especially since this album ends off with two very lengthy tracks the title track and the closer Each of which are 9 minutes and change respectively the former really lives up to its title because it does feel like a fever dream where you&amp;#39;re lost in various parts of a maze and the lyrics really do add to this feeling of maze Envy walls Beyond walls the Ecstasy within patterns and puzzles in reverence of this Mighty icon are complete adoration to this Locust Spirit fully immersed unto thee I will only lay forth my all the sounds of prayers and chants elated Worship in Grand fashion my soul it screams eyes shut I still see them structures and baguettes Within interwoven into the Mind&amp;#39;s Eye flesh and Faith separated these lyrics are really envious of this maze are you are you hearing this where did he go help I&amp;#39;m trapped I don&amp;#39;t want to be in the Maze anymore eventually on the track we get these blood curdling string passages in 34 with more great harmonious guitar work too uh then to follow at the very end just the the heavier riffs the crushing riffs come back for just a big explosive finish again getting slight black metal Vibes on the track and once more just loving the progression of this track it&amp;#39;s a roller coaster ride and I&amp;#39;m on the edge of my seat for every moment and the closer to follow from here actually continues on this guitar string combo but I would say does it even better and makes even more room for the strings to the point where it&amp;#39;s almost giving like post rock or post metal Vibes but with death metal style vocals and a kind of progressive song structure I&amp;#39;m sold a especially since the string sections are so good and they really kind of take the rein on the song at a few points it really adds not just to the stylistic diversity of the record but the emotional diversity of the album too because as the song progresses it just feels more tortured and uh sorrowful even the vocals are coming off uh more pain than they were in many previous passages where you know you&amp;#39;re getting these very kind of standard deep guttural death metal style growls and reading more into the lyrics on the track uh they ALS reinforce this Narrative of sadness and pain and it also seems like the maze this album is about is a horrible place it was but a facade we have been tricked the maze has led to Great Horrors and with that we end the album musically sonically and narratively and in a very profoundly dark place which also very impressive that this record uh really just kind of works in layers it&amp;#39;s doing Stellar things on the production side on the song structure and uh Musical and instrumental Arrangement side on the performance side on the songw writing and storytelling side and finally there&amp;#39;s just this interesting mix of extreme and progressive metal and rock styles coming together into an album that is uh just very focused very cohesive while simultaneously balancing so many different things very well there are some aspects to the album that I feel like didn&amp;#39;t quite go far enough and uh maybe some guitar tones and vocal passages come off a bit uh maybe standard or to average for death metal today but those are some very minor nitpicks and observations on what is just you know pretty much a fantastic album from a band that I think deserves way more attention than they&amp;#39;re currently getting I&amp;#39;m feeling a light to decent nine on this album transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what

    "transcript": "the yellow flannel again cuz you like the music hey everyone Anthony fantano here internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new queda record scrapyard this is a new record from producer rapper songwriter singer qua AKA Ben lasi a guy who has made one of the most radical and surprising artistic transitions of any artist operating in the internet age over the past 10 years maybe it&amp;#39;s kind of obvious and old news to be pointing this out and rehashing it at this point but not too long ago qua was simply a rapper trying to make a name for himself through technical flashy flows and deliveries as an independent entity on the YouTube platform now the term YouTube rapper is often one that is associated with a lot of negative baggage and for good reason a lot of the artists who operate within the circuit and the fans who uh follow these people are very devoted like Eminem stands kind of who cheer on their new favorite upand cominging lyrical Miracles as they throw out outof touch proclamations about uh saving the game and how you know they&amp;#39;re exactly what hip-hop needs right now now was qua one of the most obnoxious and Grading of those artists who were kind of appealing in this way no certainly not but there were certainly artistic parallels there that uh were preventing him from appealing outside of that world post 2019 queda has done a lot of growing he has gained a lot of self-awareness also showcased a newfound desire to explore other sounds and styles genres which brings us to the sudden and unexpected transition point of 2021s from me to you an album that very much saw Ben still in touch with his hip-hop Roots but on this one he was also incorporating elements of R&amp;amp;B of Art Pop of glitch music too a bit and while all this unbridled experimentation uh did kind of lead to an album that was a little bloated lacking in focus and overall direction I couldn&amp;#39;t really deny how ambitious of a move it was for him and just how great some of the songs turned out too it was very much a I didn&amp;#39;t know he had it in him type moment but this record wasn&amp;#39;t the end of uh Ben&amp;#39;s artistic transition here he would actually go on to blow listeners away even further with the following I didn&amp;#39;t mean to haunt you in 2022 a concept record where much of what was said and wrapped on this LP was told from the perspective of a ghost character it was a more focused and more cohesive album overall uh not just narratively but sonically as well as qua delivered to us a series of instrumentals that were even more a seamless blend of all the genres I mentioned previously with this thing it was really getting difficult to categorize queda as just a rapper much less a YouTube rapper as he&amp;#39;s really now just generally a musical artist through and through who seemingly can do and try to do whatever he puts his mind to and the level of Versatility qua has reached in a handful of short years uh is honestly kind of insane needs to be studied as the kids would say which is especially true of this new record of his here scrapyard with the tracks Being Framed as a mix of older and new stuff material that may not have fit on his highly conceptual 2022 record but also wouldn&amp;#39;t see any home on a future project either maybe the production was too rough maybe the song overall was a bit unfinished or explored an idea sonically that uh he just just wanted to touch down on for a single track I don&amp;#39;t know regardless though listening to these tracks individually uh especially they do stand on their own artistic merits and certainly seemed worth putting out as singles or as uh little EPS last year and now with scrapyard here all of these tracks are being assembled uh and more being added to them for an overall album SL mixtape type experience so yes again in the track list here we have songs that fans may have already heard dust cutter alak cart easier guess who even if I tried under my skin you don&amp;#39;t know me like that I make it look effortless and even more so than the I didn&amp;#39;t mean to haunt material I&amp;#39;m finding a lot of these tracks just being difficult to Define in terms of their sound their style their influences I mean for sure there are lots of touches and splashes of uh modern internet era hip hop across the board be that trap be that boombap hip hop autoc crw stuff artists who are both mainstream and underground more abstract uh artists who inhabit more of that mid tier as well of popularity Brock Hampton for example I mean Kevin abstract does appear on the last track of this record so there&amp;#39;s that and then there are a lot of moments where Ben very clearly is being heavily influenced by emo adjacent singers and songwriters such as Connor Oberst so we have some of those songwriting Styles blending and on top of that uh many of these songs are encased in production that is so detail heavy and Lush and layered but also messy chaotic lowf the sounds on this record simultaneously strike me at points as harsh as ugly but also grand and mountainous at times I&amp;#39;m reminded of the Grim and Eerie horrors of Dan barretts have a nice life while other tracks bring the warm Blissful fuzz of My Bloody Valentine and Shou Gay&amp;#39;s music more broadly and what balance we&amp;#39;re striking with all of these different sounds and influences really depends on the track you&amp;#39;re listening to here because sure while on the production side much of the time the Beats Loops repetitions uh do read as if they&amp;#39;re assembled much like any hip-hop song whether or not a given track here reads as a hip-hop song on the surface kind of depends on what Ben is offering on top of it vocally and lyrically the songs being yourself and even if I tried for example are a few of my favorites here and stylistically I find both of these songs uh kind of impossible to categorize between their ritualistic percussion ghostly vocals thumping 808s glitchy sound effects distorted bass shouty rap sung lead vocals really linear song structures too that are always evolving again not enti sure what these tracks are but I love them meanwhile there are other cuts on here that Reed is just being straightforward rap inspired moments be that way too many friends which is some great commentary on friendship on personal connections on letting people in and boundaries it really is like an indie piano ballad boom bap hybrid That Couldn&amp;#39;t sound any better than it does especially thanks to Ben&amp;#39;s solid rapping then guess who is a pretty experimental hip-hop no-brainer but then conversely under my skin is uh some very dramatic emo style songwriting in the vein of a Connor Oberst wrapped in this super haunting atmosphere uh that kind of seems way more out there than what you would usually catch on one of his LPS there&amp;#39;s also a similar influence on the song alart 2 featuring Breakin but this track goes in more of a bedroom emo pop Direction that&amp;#39;s super on Trend right now which is something I&amp;#39;m usually a little on the fence with a lot of the time but I got to be honest Ben has put together easily one of the best tracks in this vein I&amp;#39;ve ever heard here especially with all the Stellar melodic rap runs Nimble baselines to like something you would catch out of a flying Lotus record generally the sound play across this mixtape is just so many Cuts above what I&amp;#39;m normally hearing on any given record I have to review weak to week and I&amp;#39;m just in awe of how well Ben has been able to create a little Sonic World here that feels uh both harsh textured weird yeah again I&amp;#39;ve said all this already but also other worldly and surreal and uh refined like an orchestra piece or something it&amp;#39;s really giving like the glow part to in that respect uh though it&amp;#39;s assembled with the Precision uh that only somebody could bring to the table if they&amp;#39;re kind of like you know a Daw Master but really no matter what track I&amp;#39;m listening to here I&amp;#39;m just constantly in awe of how chaotic it sounds but simultaneously uh very carefully interconnected and assembled and the end result is just super evocative on these tracks I feel like I&amp;#39;m being dragged through the depths of Hell or you know even being shot across the Galaxy like on tracks like you don&amp;#39;t know me like that which is a dramatic tiny voiced piano ballad that bursts eventually into this Lush Banger with Punchy beats touching Arrangements meanwhile easier with its super slick guitar passages and woodwind bits that are just smudged and mutated sonically to the point where they just come across as unreal yeah that&amp;#39;s a stunning Sonic moment too and on top of this track along with many others here is kind of a lyrical Flex where Ben is going in detail around all of this emotional turbulence it&amp;#39;s a strange and twisted portrayal of love and obsession with somebody who he seems to be really into but maybe he&amp;#39;s also settling for but uh he can&amp;#39;t say no he can&amp;#39;t back away he&amp;#39;s just infatuated and maybe he&amp;#39;s acknowledging that the attraction is there because he doesn&amp;#39;t want to be alone but he&amp;#39;s not willing to kind of cut things off and fully separate uh look it&amp;#39;s really complicated and displaying the emotions on this track as such comes across as very intentional I&amp;#39;m going to wrap things up with I guess a few issues here I mean there are some tracks that I think showcase some great ideas bring some key Vibes to the table but are maybe a little too short and underdeveloped as an entire song at the end of the day uh be that I make it look effortless as well as guide dog too and then there&amp;#39;s pretty privilege which I mean there are some Sonic ideas that I find interesting but much of of the time the droning Sonic fuzz that pervades a lot of this track uh kind of keeps the song from fully translating I think some of the beats are a little too blown out in sunburn too though I do love those Grizzly baresque vocal harmonies on the back end of the track and how they stack up so epically you can really tell uh Ben did his Indie homework on this one outside that I suppose the overall Sonic presentation of this mixtape is a little sloppy but again I I feel like with it being a tape of sorts that&amp;#39;s kind of a part of the charm and doesn&amp;#39;t really take away from the songs as pretty much all the various pieces of instrumentation and lyrics vocals are all translating really well but yeah there are powerful emotional personal and wellth thought out well orchestrated and produced bangers from front to end on this thing and it&amp;#39;s kind of crazy how on this project of Lucy&amp;#39;s effectively I think Ben has continued to evolve and really show how special of an artist he is at the end of the day which is why I&amp;#39;m feeling a strong A2 light n on this one TR position have you given this record a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should I review next hit the like

this is the newest and seventh F length official studio album from singer and songwriter Miss Chelsea wolf whose stuff I have been covering for over a decade at this point and it&amp;#39;s been interesting to see her grow over the years uh in terms of visibility and Artistry really becoming one of the most respected musicians on uh the gothic music circuit currently and in addition to that showcasing just how versatile stylistically you can be while maintaining a position in that lane there&amp;#39;s been a lot of cool creative contrast across her most recent albums for example you have Abyss which for a while was my favorite record of hers as well as his spun these were two of her heaviest LPS at the time that she dropped them many moments on these records sounded massive and embraced these crushing Doom metal guitars then not too long after this in 2019 uh Chelsea put out birth of violence which saw her stripping back things quite a bit more aesthetically and instrumentally with a bunch of songs and more of a chamber folk and Gothic country style past this point chela has had some collaborations like blood moon one with metal core Legends converge also the xfilm score with Tyler Bates which now brings us to she reaches out to she reaches out to she where I actually think Chelsea has managed to drop one of her best records yet again with a new direction as well one that is still heavy but is still less indebted to those Doom metal guitars that defined abyss and his spun embracing instead a lot more Electronics synths effects General soundplay too there are a lot of industrial Vibes on this LP now Chelsea&amp;#39;s music usually relies on some level of atmosphere and Ambiance but that&amp;#39;s even more so the case on this new LP now that she&amp;#39;s not trying to crush me with these saturated guitar mixes or Flex her songwriter muscle with some acoustic Cuts Like with the Reverb drenched whisper Echoes on the apply titled Whispers in the Echo chamber which is contrasted with these groaning revving glitching walls of distorted tones all of which reads like Chelsea&amp;#39;s very own mythical Eerie brand of trares sound design overall it&amp;#39;s a stunning intro that really sets the tone for the album well and if Chelsea somehow got a fat check off of it because it was used in a horror movie trailer or something I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised the pace on the record picks up with the following House of self undoing which hits hard with these Punchy looping drum braks droning distorted tones and synth layers which all sound very creepy and wobbly like the floorboards of a haunted house there&amp;#39;s a killer vocal performance attached to the song too it&amp;#39;s really Chelsea&amp;#39;s witchy beckoning siren song with some chilling harmonies on the back end too between its relaxed entrancing beats and increasingly dense mix the track everything turns blue is more of a slowly developing experience than a formally segmented song and I usually prefer the latter to the former but in this instance the sound design the mixing the performance the vocals are just so good I&amp;#39;m just at a loss for words the otherworldly energy of the song is just overwhelming and yeah okay lost for words um the song tunnel lights has a similar appeal but relies a bit more on these foror and Dusty piano cords as well as wintry atmospheres and effects surrounding the beat which takes on more of a trip hop Vibe with an excellent build toward the end too it&amp;#39;s kind of like being Blinded By The Very lights the song&amp;#39;s lyrics describe then the Lial is one of the catchier songs on the record honestly it is a slow and brooding track but still its refrains of all you ever wanted was the Lial stick hard and is this track in reference to a breakup a separation of some sort it does seem to again make the case that all this person that she&amp;#39;s referencing wanted was something surface level and maybe meaningless deeper into the lyrics Chelsea says she feels left behind but eventually comes back stronger and finalizes things with I&amp;#39;m in your dreams I&amp;#39;m in your song now everybody sings along that sounds like tea the song salt is similar in that it&amp;#39;s also somber but snappy too and brings back the trip hop Vibes once again I would say this track is especially Portis head Cod too but I think Chelsea brings her own specific and gorgeous subtle slightly frightening energy to this whole sound now just when you think the record is done pulling out all the stops bringing surprises here comes Unseen World to sound even more stunning with some mountainous harmonious layers and synths and drums that honestly feel orchestral in some passages but it&amp;#39;s not too sterile or grandiose or anything like that in execution as Chelsea&amp;#39;s vocals on the track are kind of harrowing and in addition to that you have these uh distorted skittering bits of percussion repeating in the background again providing that electronic that industrial touch uh kind of feels like a totally burnt out bit of symbol looping over and over the balladry on the record comes back on the Track Place in the Sun where you have some gorgeous piano passages and ascending synth leads between that and Chelsea&amp;#39;s lyrics the whole track kind of feels like I&amp;#39;m listening to a ghost sing about moving on into the great beyond then the closing track very much reads as a song of love and devotion which is an interesting touch considering how many dark portrayals of love and connection there are on the album cuz while this track does sound just as heavy and dark as many other songs on here the sentiment of its lyrics is kind of sweet and warm as Chelsea sings about being willing to Walk Through the flames of Hell pretty much for another person and again the very final moments of this track are loud as hell they&amp;#39;re crushing but that bitterness is cut with the sweetness of these vocal harmonies uh calling out don&amp;#39;t let me go don&amp;#39;t give me up and it&amp;#39;s all quite the emotional and Sonic display there are some rattling bits of metal percussion on the verses that I&amp;#39;m not too crazy about on this track kind of take me out of the overall dark Vibe of it and I will say going back earlier into the track list the song eyes like Nightshade I&amp;#39;m not crazy about four similar reasons as I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s one of the stronger songs on here melodically progression does meander a little bit and on top of it some of the uh weirder and more left field bits of sound or percussion it&amp;#39;s coming across a little junkyard like we&amp;#39;re just throwing anything that we can into the track to make it just feel a bit messy whereas the instrumental pallets on pretty much every other song Here feel so well-groomed and specific and purposeful outside of those very minor criticisms though I think this is an incredible record one of Chelsea&amp;#39;s best if not her best Stellar vocal performances songs production progressions everything and surely it&amp;#39;s going to stand out as one of the best Gothic albums of the Year feeling a decent to strong nine on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you

    "transcript": "hi everyone quick the shot Tano here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of the new sampa album Lai this is the long awaited sophomore LP from UK R&amp;amp;B and soul singer songwriter and producer sampa an extremely talented guy but also an extremely elusive guy who is no stranger to building up anticipation if you remember his first big break in the music industry came by way of a bunch of appearances on the debut record of electronic music producers subtract his vocal performances on that LP were showstoppers they were gorgeous that was way back in 2011 SFA did treat us to a little EP of material in 2013 but it would actually take years from there for us to get a fulllength debut that was in 2017 obviously he was in no rush to release this thing and he didn&amp;#39;t necessarily need to be not only because he was continuing to land some impressive vocal features in the meantime more with subract a Solange he was also on Kanye&amp;#39;s life of Pablo but also even though the current day speed and turnover of the music industry says otherwise fans will actually wait for an artist when they&amp;#39;re displaying a unique level of talent it was not the most versatile album out there for sure but the songs were finally crafted the vocal performances were great overall it was an album that was worth the wait but if you thought that putting a record out would mean that The Floodgate would break and we get like a followup sooner rather than later from SAA you you guessed wrong cuz now this next record here uh we&amp;#39;re getting 6 years after process and honestly it is an improvement on all fronts sampa is still scratching those emotional itches with his Dynamic beautiful voice but also exploring different emotional modes too vocally be at the quick staccato leads he&amp;#39;s hitting us with on the song Spirit 2.0 we also get some very eerie mournful vocal leads that ride these tense repetitive piano phrases on Dancing circles sampa also increased the vocal versatility of this record too with some other vocalists and group vocals which certainly make the final moments of the intro track more ear grabbing and also gives the first leg of Jonathan El seagull a kind of dramatic and Theatrical spin which brings me to the lyrics on the record as sampa is getting more big picture and even conceptual with his writing for example when I originally heard Spirit 2.0 as a single I thought that spare bar referencing Jonathan Livingston Seagull was interesting but what I didn&amp;#39;t see coming is that multiple sections of this record would essentially be taking inspiration directly and indirectly from that Fable cuz there&amp;#39;s a lot of intentional parallels peppered throughout this record here with its themes of exploration personal growth existentialism as well as growing into a greater awareness of things like time love change spirituality individuality and fatherhood I&amp;#39;d say there&amp;#39;s certainly a question as to whether or not sampa effectively ties all of these ideas up in a neat or conclusive fashion at the end of the project nevertheless though he does hit uh some powerful and heartening Peaks emotionally toward the Finish like with the song evidence which is clearly in tribute to his daughter and this search for meaning in Life or evidence of their being meaning in life that&amp;#39;s kind of a mission on much of this LP but on this particular track he takes the existence of his child as evidence for that meaning Plus on the instrumental side with all these rich warm pianos hand drums and group vocals it&amp;#39;s bringing kind of dreamy Stevie Wonder Vibes meanwhile what if you hypnotize me may not be my favorite tune on the project the messaging is very much about this struggle of putting words to your feelings plus this is one of many tracks on the record that makes use of flight as a theme in this specific context as a means of escaping persistent worries the song also makes mention of the therapy and being hypnotized as a way to I guess kind of change your own thought processes it&amp;#39;s as if SAA is trying to escape from the way that his mind works and it&amp;#39;s almost like the song is guilty of what it&amp;#39;s trying to rebel against especially with uh the tune I think being sacrificed at the hand of just getting a lot of messaging across Rose tint as a closer I think is okay it&amp;#39;s a lowkey epilog type moment musically it doesn&amp;#39;t have as much bite as other Cuts here but uh it does come AC cross is genuinely introspective so yeah again the ending of this thing is okay thankfully I&amp;#39;m thoroughly impressed with the rest of the record though be that some of the songs I mentioned earlier or plenty of others with Stellar songwriting and vocal performances the inspiring Spirit 2.0 the super catchy only the tense and mesmerizing dancing circles there&amp;#39;s also inclination Compass which I think is the most tender ballad SAA has put to tape so far the word elegant isn&amp;#39;t strong enough to describe the Elegance of this track there&amp;#39;s also supended too I love the way saa&amp;#39;s vocal harmonies kind of cascade over one another on this track it gives the song This Rich layered kind of melty feel meanwhile K go back explores the concept of the past and regrets justest and obsession with going back despite pretty much having to move forward no matter what this kind of ties into larger themes around the record with regards to time and uh things being infinite are there beginnings and ends to the stuff that we experience in our lives or is it just like one continuous thing bridging onto another thing Beyond this I would like to shout out the production on this LP because the vocals I&amp;#39;ve been going on and on about all sound fantastic they&amp;#39;re all well mixed and recorded the posos and keys throughout the record sound fantastic too but I&amp;#39;d also like to say this record feels like the next logical step for sampa cuz once again he&amp;#39;s bringing a pretty Forward Thinking and futuristic sound with a lot of subtle creative electronic touches effects and glitches maybe my favorite thing about some of these instrumentals is the beats which at times can be very busy very detailed cuz there are numerous tracks with these very intricate breaks just firing away in the background and they&amp;#39;re groovy and dizzying but simultaneously subtle enough to where they&amp;#39;re not overtaking the track throwing the songs off kilter they really add a ton to these songs and fill a lot of appropriate space and surprisingly are just not too much despite them uh being so much more active and busy than the songs sitting on top of them overall this LP I think is wonderful it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s Unique it&amp;#39;s gorgeous it&amp;#39;s well written produced sampa did make us wait a while he did but I cannot follow him because he outdid himself for sure he gave us another record that was really well worth the wait and if he takes six or seven more years to put out the next one if it&amp;#39;s quality again that&amp;#39;s totally fine feeling a light to decent n on this one TR Z have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the

    "transcript": "hi everyone Anthony fantano here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new sufan Stevens record javelin this is a brand new album from singer songwriter multi-instrumentalist composer Mr sufian Stevens it is his 10th solo LP and it&amp;#39;s proving to be a fan favorite pretty quickly and it&amp;#39;s not hard to see why first off there&amp;#39;s been a large outpouring of love and support for the record uh that&amp;#39;s coincided with some pretty tragic announcements from Stevens he is currently on a slow recovery from a shocking diagnosis of guon beret syndrome plus this record is also said to be a tribute to his late partner Evans Richardson fans only came to learn of him recently through this announcement as Stevens has been very consistent about keeping his private life private over the years so obviously this is pretty heavy information and I understand as a result many fans and critics will purely view the album through the lens of these events but it&amp;#39;s also important to note that this record intentionally or not artistically speaking is a serious return to form for Stevens not to imply he ever fell off creatively though it&amp;#39;s just that it&amp;#39;s been almost 20 years since he dropped many of the Grand and ornate folk albums that made him an indie darling in the first place and since then Stevens&amp;#39;s musical whims have taken him some other places into compositions into art pop into ambient music he&amp;#39;s gone deeper into electronic music and come through with some interesting collaborations too all while maintaining some of the most distinct characteristics of his sound you could say but conversely Javelin Feels Like Home in the best way this record is a 10-track run of Plucky warm rustic folk instrumentation covered with lavish layers of group vocals of stunning arrangements and orchestral hits that are occasionally enhanced Tastefully I might add with electronics and some heavier beats I am reminded of some of sufian post 2000s output that kind of nodded in this direction again like 2010&amp;#39;s all delighted people VP or the more elaborate instrumental presentations he brought to all of the carry and L material in the live setting so like those moments Javelin is the real sufan deal right from the start the opener goodbye Evergreen which is a somber piano ballad that lyrically is maybe the most direct address that Stevens has to his late partner on the record and the way his passing made him reflect on loss and fear and the fragility of his own life there&amp;#39;s also this cathartic and dissonant shrill Rush of instrumentation that comes after the line deliver me from the poison pain which is a hideous but also beautiful release of all these complicated feelings around obviously this very difficult time and between all the calls of goodbye Evergreen you know I love you this is just an absolutely devastating sendoff followed by this droning bed of instrumentation that gracefully transitions into uh something that feels more like a jubilee of Woodwinds and rhythms it&amp;#39;s like we&amp;#39;ve suddenly moved into this celebration of his partner&amp;#39;s memory and the love they shared and it&amp;#39;s seriously an emotional roller coaster in that sense now this track effectively leads us into the track a running start which seems to rewind to a time when this love that Stevens is singing about uh was more fresh or at the peak of intensity and Whimsy there&amp;#39;s a lot of beautiful and vivid imagery in the lyrics as it feels like Stevens is trying to tell a story and process his emotions around all of this in kind of a nonlinear fashion and I&amp;#39;m definitely here for it especially when it leads to these dazzling instrumental ascents like we get at the end of this track too the emotional tone kind of shifts and some dreads sets in with the track will anybody ever love me which I think is as sincere a question can get on this record Stevens asks that this love be for good reason and not for sport and also contrasts this uh with the verse lyrics that display a lot of violent imagery and almost martyrdom maybe a display of what it feels like to go on without this kind of love or what he&amp;#39;ll put up with to get it everything that rises is another one of Stevens&amp;#39;s many intimate musical monologues that take kind of a religious angle asking Jesus us on this track that he&amp;#39;d be lifted up and not cast into hell and going on to say that everything that rises must converge which I think is his way of showing that he&amp;#39;s accepting the eventual finality of everything meanwhile genuflecting ghost also seeks to find some kind of peace and solace in prayer but also maybe this spectral connection too it&amp;#39;s not the strongest tune or instrumental progression on the record but aesthetically it is genuinely beautiful and it really nails that textured Fusion of live and electronic instrumentation that I&amp;#39;ve often felt torn about on records like age of odds which obviously at this point is like a Stevens classic regardless though I&amp;#39;m far more Enchanted by The Gentle piano arpeggios all over my red little fox which makes a mystifying combo with Stevens&amp;#39;s trademark doubled up hush to lead vocals this track also arrives to one of the best finales of any song here with the chorus vocals and sparkling metallic Melodies taking on kind of a wintry Vibe then there&amp;#39;s also so you are tired which was another single in the leadup to this album loved it when I first heard it and now that I have more context about the record it hits even harder as the story is very much about one partner kind of growing tired of the other with Stevens wondering if things have reached this point what was all of this for and what brought it here not to mention he&amp;#39;s understandably confused and upset over this change of heart but still feels in love to some degree and I can&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;ve ever heard a track from Stevens that sounded simultaneously so defeated but also so cinematic and gorgeous especially as it reaches the crescendo around the bridge now the record&amp;#39;s final three tracks all kind of work together in tandem to make a final statement for the lp Javelin the title track of the record is a short acoustic piece which is loaded with this haunting and deep regret over rash and maybe angry decisions or actions uh that may have been engaged in and while it&amp;#39;s not entirely clear as to why he is reflecting on it in this way was it just a point time that he wished he avoided just didn&amp;#39;t happen was it something that was left unresolved or was it U an ugly ending to everything either way the sentiment of the track and the fact that he&amp;#39;s still holding on to this is very clear and this shorter track sets us up effectively for the following talk where Stevens is rejecting the fighting the conflict the tension the static and embracing love instead there&amp;#39;s also a very strange vibr on his voice which is oddly weary and Smoky on this track too of eventually through this we reach the grandest peak of instrumentation on the entire project which emphasizes these refrains of I don&amp;#39;t want to fight at all I will always love you and honestly the peak this song reaches uh emotionally and instrumentally it&amp;#39;s Indescribable you really just have to experience it for yourself but I will say he coasts down from it wonderfully with this thick and Powerful wall of instrumentation that is incredibly immersive which brings us to the closer there World which is is a short hopeful acoustic afterthought about everyone being an individual who has a role and a part to play in this world that we all God&amp;#39;s children and it&amp;#39;s actually a cover of a Neil Young song but uh clearly Stevens has taken some very huge Musical and instrumental Liberties in his version and is essentially kind of taking the message of the original track and just kind of making it work uh in the context of what he&amp;#39;s saying in this record here which is fair and I appreciate the effort to repurpose it here because it does work I will say overall Javelin while it may not be Stevens&amp;#39;s most large scale holistic or grandiose effort it&amp;#39;s still a deeply moving and personal record uh that sees him really working from a point of strength with stunning arrangements with touching singer songwriter tunes and lyrics that see him working through some of life&amp;#39;s toughest obstacles which is exactly what continues to make him such an inspiration for many artistically and personally and with records like this that will continue to be the case uh for years to come I&amp;#39;m feeling a decent two strong nine on this one transition have you given this record a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should I review next hit the like if you like Please Subscribe and please don&amp;#39;t cry hit

okay for how much uh 0 it&amp;#39;s just a title all right 0 that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not buying them that&amp;#39;s getting them for free and I&amp;#39;m not just going to giv to you for nothing we have a new album here from East Coast AB ract hip-hop Duo armed Hammer Billy Woods El Lucid true blue underground weirdos lurking in the shadows formulating Rhymes and esoteric references that you couldn&amp;#39;t even dream of they are on their sixth fulllength official album here I believe and it&amp;#39;s been great watching these two really become underground fixtures over the years in the hip-hop scene especially since I&amp;#39;ve been covering them for a decade at this point going back to their first album together how am I still looking the same 10 years ago but but back then on their early stuff I think I heard something that a lot more people are hearing now thanks to Fantastic records like paraffin as well as The Alchemist bump they got on 2021s Haram their last full length now these two have covered and pioneered a lot of ground over the past 10 years creatively and with each release I&amp;#39;m always wondering what is next for the duo where could they possibly take things next as they continue to build up this catalog that is more mystifying with each record and while I wouldn&amp;#39;t say they&amp;#39;re the most important contributors to abstract hip-hop today they definitely helped set the tone in their own way so for me to tell you this album might be the most headyy and cerebral project Armen Hammer has put out so far it&amp;#39;s saying something and that is very much Apparent from the start the opening track landlines that sees elucid and Billy Woods wrapping with pitched vocals some warped effects to on top of these reversed samples phone noises ambient noise and droning tones too it it&amp;#39;s kind of psychedelic and surreal like a shabaz palace&amp;#39;s track but delivered with the descriptive Dow and gritty Rhymes that we typically expect from Armen Hammer Billy Woods starting off his verse with I&amp;#39;d rather be codependent than be codefendants elucid on the track and be found waxing poetic on Old childhood memories which is a lot of different stuff in one track cuz as any moment this album can really go in any direction Lally and sonically as the ending of this song Here suddenly melts into all of this rumbling rattling noise that makes me feel like U I was in a dream and woke up standing in a subway car following this we have the even more ghostly woke up and ass Siri how I&amp;#39;m going to die with production from jpeg Mafia which also has a very slow syrupy ambient vibe to it that aesthetically is almost akin to that of a vapor wave piece or an old 10 trick Point never track and the energy of the song is so strange I feel like time is slowing down on this one to the point where I can just feel it stopping meanwhile woods and that are so deep into taking a more impressionist angle with their writing that I feel like I&amp;#39;ve lost the ability to uh interpret anything they&amp;#39;re saying or add any of it up and maybe it doesn&amp;#39;t add up maybe it&amp;#39;s not supposed to trying to get a firm grasp of some of these tracks uh feels like sand slipping through my fingers or like I&amp;#39;m fighting a paralysis demon meanwhile the flexible unreliability of time in memory uh leaves me feeling as if I am floating out in zero gravity with nothing to hold on to and trying to flail and control my way through it and just like it uh make my way is just a futile attempt it&amp;#39;s not going anywhere the only option I have is to really just let the weightlessness take me and also we have another ending on this track that makes it seem like the whole song was a dream sequence of some sort we&amp;#39;re waking up now even though there are a lot of obtuse passages throughout this record woods and elucid still explore a lot of the same familiar themes that you may have heard them rap about on past efforts paranoia afrocentrism societal Decay rap music cultural satire love and loved ones and there&amp;#39;s still wordsmiths about it it just takes a little bit more decoding than usual for them case and point take the Billy Woods Bar on the project uh think in cursive spit Jagged fragments every word out of my mouth drag my people backwards moving along I keep a mirror in my pocket is a really great piece of off-kilter jazz rap with these thick bursts of base and keys plus a solid guest verse from Cavalier on the track too and this is maybe the most material and Punchy song on the record thus far which up until this point has sounded very lowkey very very again cerebral very ambient and even though on this track the beats and the instrumentation are much Bolder clearly defined there&amp;#39;s still something about this song that sounds so surreal and disconnected from reality which I would also say is the case for trauma mic with its crashing symbols and strange Echoes roaring guitars and massive hits of 808s uh it it sounds like industrial hipop hell on Earth it&amp;#39;s wild it&amp;#39;s confounding as is a Beat from LP on The Gods Must Be Crazy which brings booming bass African drum samples and uh what sounds like these scattered vocal bits it&amp;#39;s one of the most insane pieces of production I&amp;#39;ve heard this year now the duo continues to Barrel into the unknown in the final leg of this thing and while these songs continue to be difficult to define or make heads or tails of they&amp;#39;re still so colorful and everchanging and engaging it&amp;#39;s like the weirdest ear candy ever whether you&amp;#39;re talking about the multiphase don&amp;#39;t lose your job which closes uh with a great spoken word outro from moreother and you also have switchboard which suddenly changes over into these Heavenly vocal Harmony passages this album just like has Oddity pinned down but no two songs are odd in the same way now as far as a couple of low points points for me on the lp let&amp;#39;s start with uh the two jungle features here one of which fits on the record the other not so much her very calm and understated appearance on you can&amp;#39;t stand right here doesn&amp;#39;t really fight through the mix and the instrumental at all the instrumental that sounds like trying to fight your way down an endlessly busy New York City street she makes much more sense with a kind of sensual appearance on the front end of Empire Boulevard there&amp;#39;s Total Recall whose verses I love but um I I this is my least favorite in strumental here by far the unending woodwind solos uh take so much away from the vocals there&amp;#39;s just a competition there sonically that shouldn&amp;#39;t be and uh what&amp;#39;s worse is that the solos aren&amp;#39;t even that good so why it&amp;#39;s so prominent on the track in the first place I don&amp;#39;t know there super Moon 2 which I&amp;#39;m sorry as much as I do like Billy&amp;#39;s contribution to this track and the instrumental to I just do not see the appeal of having lucid&amp;#39;s vocals U just decked out in these spooky V effects it sounds like something off a bad Halloween sfx tape but at least the two closing tracks on the record are solid and bring things back into more of an abstract and ambient Direction which uh again very surprised and floored at just how loose and fluid and boundaryless a lot of the production on this record sounds and not only do Billy Woods and elucid manage to wrap over all of these beats very effectively but the songs overall are actually really engaging the textures samp grooves and musical Arrangements packed into these songs are really impressive really some of the best on any Arm and Hammer project so far and I say that knowing that paraffin uh hits so damn hard and Haram was literally produced by The Alchemist so this LP in my opinion is a pretty big step up in a lot of ways is it bogged down a little bit by a few ill-conceived ideas uh here and there yes but no question and no doubt about it on the best moments of this project Billy Woods and Lucid are progressing they&amp;#39;re experimenting they&amp;#39;re advancing and they are very much defining what makes abstract hip-hop abstract hip-hop today I&amp;#39;m feeling a strong A2 aite 9 on this one Tran position have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should I review next hit the like if you like

    "transcript": "hi everyone hey then hi Tana here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new Jeff rosenstock album Hell mode singer songwriter producer multi-instrumentalist Mr Jeff rosenstock a veteran of the punk scene at this point over the years he&amp;#39;s covered all the bases from pop punk to power pop skatepunk indie rock and ska typically fun and Rowdy genres though Jeff usually finds ways to work some grim and Bittersweet elements into the Speedy drums and power chords especially in his solo stuff where he makes a lot of the Doom and Gloom seeping into his track sound epic and righteous whether we&amp;#39;re talking about some of the tragic cuts off of we cool the very tense worry or the crushing no dream his thickest and loudest heaviest project to date which he also made a ska version of I kind of prefer that record to the original but still I went into this new record mostly expecting the same as Jeff has kind of proven himself to be a very consistent guy over the years but hell mode feels like a different Jeff rosenstock one who&amp;#39;s on a better track toward a more peaceful life maintaining his sanity and his Serenity and doing a better job of distancing himself from what hurts him the record may be titled Hell mode but the Vibes are really more about the seventh track on the album heal mode as a lot of this record feels like explosive pop punk therapy like what the boisterous liked you better which has certainly grown on me since I first heard it as a single it&amp;#39;s a big acoustic-ish cut with some Grand group vocals on the hook and of course it&amp;#39;s catchy it&amp;#39;s produced well in fact I would say this is one of Jeff&amp;#39;s better produced projects it&amp;#39;s not as rough as worry I think there&amp;#39;s more space to hear everything in more clarity than there was on no dream all of the grand builds of vocals and instrumentation come through very clear and well balanced which makes those big ticket crescendos and massive finales hit hard the real selling point on this track though is Jeff&amp;#39;s descriptions of physical anxiety or being driven insane by this person who is really getting to him for whatever reasons they are and essentially wanting distance from that saying I liked you better when you weren&amp;#39;t on my mind there are similar sentiments expressed on the track graveyard song too when someone causes pain it&amp;#39;s okay to push them away essentially allowing stuff you don&amp;#39;t need in your life to fall off or disconnect with Jeff also saying [ __ ] Burning Bridges everybody start digging a graveyard for the things that need to die there&amp;#39;s even more mental health messaging on the record too with the song doubt which encourages listeners to drop their guard let it all out speak even if it feels weird even if it feels weird to be yourself meanwhile future is dumb is an anthemic pat on the back saying don&amp;#39;t let fear of the future paralyze you or make you lose hope there&amp;#39;s also a reminder to not feel like you&amp;#39;re owed anything by the world is tomorrow isn&amp;#39;t promised and I can&amp;#39;t forget to shout out the opener which is very much about accepting your own flaws and growing from them the vocals on the front end of the track are maybe a bit too distorted and saturated things seem to open up and just generally sound a lot better deeper into the track not exactly sure what this adds to the song this change this shift but it is there but still Jeff asks some pointy questions on this cut will you still love me after I [ __ ] up I&amp;#39;ve grown and changed but can it ever be enough the track is a multi-phased Epic 2 with these blast beaten guitar sections some twinkly lead Melodies on the bridge and horns harmonizing with these Grand group vocals that sound almost orchestral at the very finish and are especially crushing given refrains like took you for granted and you fell out of love remorse is also deeply expressed on the tracksoft living which is a heavy slow plotting piece of weezer-esque power pop it&amp;#39;s like something from the pink or it&amp;#39;s an ERA with how rough around the edges it is but topically it&amp;#39;s dealing in much more large-scale issues with rosenstock singing about [ __ ] Lord white supremacists and a doom fog asking societally how did we go so wrong the aforementioned heal mode is a contemplative acoustic Moment On The Record with vivid descriptions of coyotes California rain and people just people in as well as some cute lyrics about being inside on a lazy day with a lover again the title is heal mode I&amp;#39;m not surprised this track sounds like an oasis in the middle of this hell Mode album meanwhile life admin is one of the more mundane spots on the record instrumentally and lyrically but I think that&amp;#39;s by design it is a crunchy Sunny piece of power Pop That Again is giving Weezer Vibes Jeff expresses a want to make a song about nothing on the track and he kind of accomplishes that mission depicting a slice of his very above average life having seen the success that he has in music and soundtracks he&amp;#39;s obviously comfortable and enjoys that but simultaneously has a low level of contempt for the the life that he&amp;#39;s living in a way which I think think we get a better understanding of on The Closer with lyrics like don&amp;#39;t you pretend the world is treating us all equal when a person can starve as another one hops in a lift plus the JFK to Europe expenses paid I know it&amp;#39;s not okay but I still participate the song I want to be wrong picks things up in the track list once again it&amp;#39;s a high energy Anthem this time about the cognitive dissonance of seeing what&amp;#39;s wrong with the world but still having to live in it with no recourse to fix it and again Jeff wishes to be wrong about all the horrors and ills he sees in the world so he can just kind of live in Bliss and wipe it all from his mind and I guess that&amp;#39;s the thing about Jeff and this record that make it so great and engaging there&amp;#39;s a lot to unpack a lot to unpack because Jeff is a Restless thinker it&amp;#39;s like an alarm he can&amp;#39;t turn off and as a result he has no choice but to sing about it and thank God he does it so well this is an excellent record in my opinion I think it&amp;#39;s one of the best Jeff has ever done there are a few semi Duds in the track list here and there but for the most part Jeff is is improving he&amp;#39;s growing he&amp;#39;s fine-tuning and showing just how versatile Dynamic and deep these genres of music can be that are often cast off as just being kind of childish and silly this may boil down to the sentiment of the final refrain on the record as Jeff repeats stay young until you die which I think Jeff is doing exactly that very well and in a kind of mature way too I&amp;#39;m feeling a decent nine on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best

ghanian American pop singer and songwriter Amaray honestly went into this new record over here completely blind off of a random shade filled comment or tweet I got somewhere on social media saying something like so we&amp;#39;re just like not gonna review the new Amaray album and I was like oh [ __ ] what what is this energy I&amp;#39;m gonna try this album out and if it&amp;#39;s mid I&amp;#39;m gonna be so pissed but no uh it was actually it was actually fire so Amaray began to gain attention uh during the first year of the pandemic off a hot track that eventually gained so much traction it eventually earned a remix featuring none other than kaliuchi&amp;#39;s which makes total sense because I think Cali and Amber array have a lot in common creatively maybe not in a super literal sense in that I think they sound exactly the same I mean there is certainly a Common Thread between them in that they both have uh respectively light sweet dreamy voices but beyond that I think a lot of their common ground is shared in the fact that they are super versatile pop artists that borrow from a wide variety of genres and care a lot about songcraft and and and also take a pretty subtle approach now making pop music that is super soft super ethereal it can be kind of a risk going too easy can often lead to things sounding maybe too forgettable or Bland and to be fair there are a few moments on this record that do kind of meander with Amores vocals aimlessly exploring these uh very spacious beds of guitars and beats but for the most part these tracks actually have a high amount of impact despite their also high level of Elegance and chill almost like that of an early FKA twigs album but wait wait wait wait way warmer in terms of vibe and I would say more danceable too the versatility of this record is also Apparent from the jump with angels which is like hot soup on a stove top with elements of African music Asian music and high art pop music all boiling together aggressively to the point where it&amp;#39;s hard to tell what&amp;#39;s what or if the song has any super defined origin to it I would say that&amp;#39;s also the case for the song Wasted eyes also deeper into the record we get tracks that fuse together elements of again Pop R B dance hall afrobeats hip-hop and electronic music too the track co-star features all of these elegant harp arpeggios set to bustling beats that are topped with a lot of funny and flirty lyrics about astrology and star signs instrumentally and vocally the whole thing sounds like a silky sex dream we have more themes of desire and Temptation turning up on the track princess going digital too with some hot ass grooves drum fills and call and response vocals it&amp;#39;s giving fantasy dance party in this city in the middle of the night meanwhile with big steppa I don&amp;#39;t typically like my dance hall this dreamy but the touches of strings and background vocals and horns on this track are actually Stellar multiple Cuts above anything I&amp;#39;ve heard in the mainstream that has tried to take a lighter approach with the style of music I could say much the same for the track Reckless and sweet which also puts a very pillowy veneer over a lot of West African music elements Amores vocals on this track also sound especially mesmerizing and intimate then one of the most amazing crazy and surprising moments on the record comes in the form of counterfeit we have another bold Banger on here with a lot of crazy cultural fusions that seem almost m-i-a-esque and how they just like kind of Jam these various Vibes and ideas together but one of the most recognizable sounds on it is the steel drum lines from that Pharrell bead off the eclipse album Hell hath no fury for wampwamp as a huge Clips fan it&amp;#39;s kind of hard to not think of that track while listening uh to this but still Amaray does make it her own and I love on this record she can drop a track that hot that steamy that in your face but then also match it with the song disguise which is maybe the most Whimsical and Theatrical cut on the bunch especially with the male female vocal harmonies the chilly atmosphere surrounding it all and the refined touches of strings the final leg of this record also keeps things pretty interesting with sex violence and suicide the first portion of this track drags a little bit with Amaray not really going anywhere fast vocally over some very Spacey guitar arpeggios it&amp;#39;s kind of winding it&amp;#39;s a little repetitive but eventually in the final leg of the song it bursts out into this uh punk rock passage that honestly sounds more raw and interesting than many artists in the pop field just quickly kind of going Punk for a minute or two on a random song here and there the guitar Distortion combined with Amore&amp;#39;s vocals being so high pitched and shouty it it almost feels like otaboke Beaver sociopathic dance Queen is not just an excellent title for a song but yet another dreamy pop Banger aquamarine loves ecstasy I think could have used a bit more variation across its run time but still getting some big shot day Vibes off of this track in the best way water from wine all I can really say about this one is it&amp;#39;s pure ecstasy and the closer come home to God is a big final moment on this record and another surprising switch up too because we get some rock drums and some shoddy grouper frames and some very eerie breathy lead vocals on the verses too which all make for an interesting contrast from these lyrics about kind of you know going crazy on the pole with over-the-top lyrics like uh when I&amp;#39;m in that [ __ ] I&amp;#39;m above the law there&amp;#39;s a heavy and Sinister finish on the track as well with like some distorted bass and once again really impressed with what Amory brought to the table on this album The diversity the texture the Tunes the vocal performances the details this thing is creative

    "transcript": "hi everyone here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new McKinley Dixon record beloved Paradise Jazz this is a brand new LP from Virginia rapper McKinley Dixon following his pandemic breakout record for my mama and anyone who look like her a record of really ornate dense and conscious Jazz rap that made for one of the best underground releases of that year though maybe not the most distinct considering some of the comparisons it drew to artists like Kendrick and avantale Bowling Club but the rapping in instrumentals across this LP were pretty solid even if very obviously they were kind of Homespun and a little rough around the edges ultimately came away from this project thinking Dixon was an artist worth watching so that&amp;#39;s why I checked out this new project which going into it I was kind of surprised and maybe a little worried because it was like 20 minutes shorter than its predecessor and overall doesn&amp;#39;t even reached 30 minutes in length is this thing even an album is it just a glorified EP I don&amp;#39;t know but you know what after listening to it even though this thing is paired down uh runtime wise I found the wrapping to be more distinct this time around and uh the instrumentals are freaking incredible and totally Next Level really fitting again in that jazz rap pocket but uh now just like wow uh really Grand really layered really mountainous right from the start of this thing it&amp;#39;s clear that McKinley is going to be coming from a different place sonically and instrumentally bringing us on a journey that is going to be more cinematic because track one we have Hannaford&amp;#39;s Tony which is a spoken word interlude slash intro and a pretty Eerie reading of a Tony Morrison passage one that shifts between sounding idyllic and also kind of unsettling this passage ties into the record once again later on the song dedicated to Tar feather which may also be another allusion to Tony&amp;#39;s work because the nods to her don&amp;#39;t just make for a cool little poetic intro on uh this album The Influence runs deeper than that as even the title of this record itself is a nod to three books in her beloved Trilogy and furthermore you can tell from McKinley&amp;#39;s pen game that he&amp;#39;s well read and has a narrator&amp;#39;s heart and really wants to write and assemble something that is larger than himself which is apparent right from the First full song on the record Sun I Rise an honest to God stunner between its Harps and big drums and Flowery strings listening to this song feels like just hanging in the classiest most well-decorated room it&amp;#39;s really giving a little Sims simbi levels of just grandiosity with the background instrumentation and once more Dixon is sounding more expressive than ever on the vocal and lyrical side especially in the second verse as he&amp;#39;s dropping lines like we bent the block so many times car almost slipped right over said I became a better liar as I&amp;#39;ve gotten older is it because the tongue got sharper or because my heart got colder again moving poetic incredible start to the project mezzanine tip and by comparison isn&amp;#39;t as sweet on the ears but it is a superb expression in griminess the loose and noisy percussion on this thing sounds like bike parts rattling coins dropping chains the blood curdling strings on this track are amazing too there are a lot of a very creepy demonic doubled up vocals as well it&amp;#39;s freaky and deeply unhinged easily the darkest pocket on the entire record the rich piano chops and twinkling leads and big catchy group vocals make run run a lot more anthemic by comparison it&amp;#39;s a cute tune but has a grave contrast as the chorus&amp;#39;s lyrics deal and running away from guns and gunshots in a playground setting and it&amp;#39;s a song of survival and connecting with others as well as persevering beyond the threats to your life in violent surroundings or just kind of suffering under a system that makes it more likely that you&amp;#39;re not going to live past to your 20 it&amp;#39;s ultimately a song of survival and connecting with others in terms of its messaging and its background instrumentation it&amp;#39;s very roots-esque then there&amp;#39;s the smooth and glamorous Lie from the kitchen table which not only Sports a great feature from guys Guevara but Jesus the sweet Keys the saxophones the bass how is all the instrumentation on this thing coming together because it sounds better and richer than a lot of the stuff I hear on mainstream records somehow Dixon fit the sound of a big budget in a really small package there&amp;#39;s also the grand horn lines on the track Tyler forever which sound kind of like the grandiose horn sections that you hear attached to a marching band or a drum line but with a Southern beat kind of hanging in the back of it and a handful of witty metal themed bars before we hit one of the choruses on the song about nine dudes being messed up in a van them boys Slipknot I also love the b-switch in the second half of this track too where the instrumentation all of a sudden goes super soft kind of fairy tale we also have these stories so far as well as the actual story so far the song itself where I think we hear our first major misstep on the project Celine Hayes&amp;#39;s feature I thought as far as delivery and vocal presence was just okay felt a bit off even the mix on it I think could have been a little better dig the vibe dig the content but I just don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s the strongest placement on the record but overall even as a low point it&amp;#39;s not that bad like this track is still a pretty good overall and just one more a pretty positive addition to a very solid tracklist which brings us to the very Grand and Jazzy closing title track with those Nimble lead Melodies and the group vocals and the kids chorus Dixon is really pulling out all the stops on this record and going all in on like this 28 minute little project which again I&amp;#39;m just amazed at how much meaning and emotional depth and complexity and punch this thing carries in the runtime time that it has there&amp;#39;s not a lot of material here but what material is here is just like so damn there&amp;#39;s not a lull there&amp;#39;s not a stop there&amp;#39;s not a nothing on this project and even the moments that are you know kind of introductory or you know a bit of an interlude or something like that they still add so much to the record overall yeah this is like really one of the rare instances where an artist like shortens you know the length of what they&amp;#39;re putting out and somehow just ends up being more fire as I&amp;#39;m feeling a light nine on this project yeah transition have you given this record a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate

    "transcript": "hi everyone say that he named Tano here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new Lonnie Holley record Oh Me Oh My this is a brand new LP from singer songwriter painter sculptor Lonnie Holly this is his second album for the Jag Jaguar label and though Holly currently at age 72 has been an artist for decades now he came into music in a professional capacity much later in life take that everyone whining on the internet uh I&amp;#39;m 25 now my potential for a music career is over plus it&amp;#39;s been over 10 years since Lonnie&amp;#39;s breakout into music with just before music in 2012 and now his latest project here is currently his most talked about and well received to date and it&amp;#39;s not hard to see why we have consistently impressive features on this thing from the likes of more mother Bon Iver Sharon Van Etten as well as rem&amp;#39;s Michael Stipe we also have pristine Vivid and Intergalactic production from jackknife Lee which really brings the other worldly qualities of the music here to life then there&amp;#39;s Lonnie Holly himself who is a magnetic vocalist and performer there&amp;#39;s this amazing presence and Timbre to his voice this mesmerizing vibrato as well when he locks into it his voice also has the smokiness and the texture of like an old trumpet there&amp;#39;s a lot of volume a lot of sustain a great command of pitch too but simultaneously there&amp;#39;s something really weary and flawed about a lot of the singing on this record which brings a level of emotional rawness to the table how expressive of a singer Lonnie is will most likely hit you immediately and there&amp;#39;s nowhere that&amp;#39;s better Illustrated than in the content of the actual music and how he performs it how he acts it out take the title track for example which is far from the catchiest and most visceral song on the record but it&amp;#39;s still a prime example of this Project&amp;#39;s Central thesis we have Michael Stipe singing somewhat eerily in the background of this thing as elegant piano chords and ambient tones kind of build the tracks Foundation meanwhile Holly on the track sings through a series of realizations about his own emotional traumas processing his past understanding himself and how a lot of what he&amp;#39;s dealing with at least personally comes down to his family life and his childhood the track&amp;#39;s an emotionally powerful meditation that fuses together elements of ambient music spoken word and spirituals there&amp;#39;s a piece later on the record that brings together similar genre elements kindness will follow your tears which comes to an even grander finish and also includes some great vocal Harmony layers from Bon Iver and lyrically I read this track to be very much about having an emotional breakthrough of sorts a profound Moment of clarity with Lonnie getting in touch with his feelings and accepting them addressing this long neglected inner child in a way which I think he does later on the record in an even more overt way on I can&amp;#39;t hush which is a track that&amp;#39;s very much about bottling up various trauma and terrible things from the past and having seen his loved ones and relatives have to do that at various points sort of embodying that same behavior himself but simultaneously portraying himself as a baby that can&amp;#39;t hush that has to say it out loud that has to acknowledge it that is going to break the cycle in a way the closing track future children I think is pretty essential to this narrative as well not my favorite cut on the record as it seems like more of an interlude or kind of like a you know fleeting afterthought we have some repeating synth sequences in the background and Lonnie vocally on top of that with some heavy vocal effects to make him sound like a robot as he goes on about future children dealing with a power failure no power signal lost no winners in the billion dollar lottery which is a curious note to end on but I suppose one that makes sense given that the opening track on this thing pretty much poses the idea that life and the world that we live in is like a series of tests that we have to endure and go through through so I think that&amp;#39;s kind of a quick picture of the records overall messaging at least on a lot of the ambient leaning Cuts in the track list Which is far from the sum total of this record&amp;#39;s sounds and stories because there is the song Earth will be there which brings a panoramic display of meditative horns and percussion decorated with all these surreal effects and Jazz flourishes the track sounds like we&amp;#39;re going on an Intergalactic Journey one meant to make you feel microscopic in relation to the very gargantuan world we live in but we also take a moment in the midst of the track to zero in on generational burdens brought upon by institutions like slavery which comes by way of this amazing warm other feature on the song deeper into the track from Lonnie we hear these themes of needing protection or even a guardian that isn&amp;#39;t there being lost in a way as well which is a recurring theme through the record like on if we get lost they will find us which features an amazing vocal performance from Mali singer Rokia Kone from here I want to mention the track Mount Megs which is handily the most unsettling moment on this entire record Holly reflects on time he spent in a juvenile facility when he was a kid this would have been back in the 60s and the whole thing is set to these noisy guitars and blood curdling strings the finish of the track is absolutely harrowing as Lonnie describes having the Curiosity beaten out of him damned out of him it&amp;#39;s also pretty clear that this track sits at the center of a lot of the trauma that relates to all the childhood trauma that is being kind of knotted toward at various points on the album better get that crop in soon has one of the most layered and satisfying beats on the entire LP there&amp;#39;s this intense sense of unease coming off of some of the horn hits and creepy droning tones in the background too and none of us have but a little while is one of the more linear cuts on the entire record in terms of its large-scale instrumental build it&amp;#39;s so immersive the fluttering Woodwinds the touching strings droning horns and Reverb drench pianos you can really swim in this thing a lot of the lyrics on track come down to our short time here on Earth as individuals but maybe also just as people generally like our existence is essentially a blink of the eye but simultaneously I think the takeaway from this track is also to just realize how precious life is which is a message that&amp;#39;s also conveyed on I am part of the Wonder although I will say this is not one of my favorite cuts on the record because I think much of the drama that is brought to the table by a lot of these tracks is lost in the faster funkier beat and electronics in the instrumental and overall I do have to say this was kind of a a mind-blowing and emotionally impactful project for me Lonnie jackknife and all collaborators involved really killed it the lyrics sentiments emotions themes and Concepts on this record are wonderful and focused consistent the production Arrangements layering and performances are great too and all the features on this thing add to this record in their own own way as well there were a few moments that underwhelmed me a bit and I think as an overall project maybe it could have been longer but outside of that I don&amp;#39;t really have many issues with uh oh me oh my I think it&amp;#39;s a beautiful and a profound little album I&amp;#39;m feeling a light too decent nine on this one transition have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best or the best what

    "genre": "Avant-Garde Metal",
    "transcript": "hi everyone 69 here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new liturgy album 9369 6 for over a decade now the new york-based metal band liturgy has been one of my favorite metal projects of the modern era masterminded by producer composer philosopher guitarist and singer Rena hunt Hendrick liturgy has made a name for itself boldly pushing the boundaries of black metal not just sonically and aesthetically but also ideologically but I&amp;#39;ll say the general concepts were pretty easy to grasp during the aesthetica era back in 2011 with hendrix&amp;#39;s philosophical Embrace of things like God and light while also trying to make the genre rhythmically feel less static more fluid personally I would call this project a bold and creative success even if around this time in the band&amp;#39;s career they had more naysayers than they did supporters seemingly now it&amp;#39;s been a while since that record came out but in many ways liturgy is the same group they were way back then hendrix&amp;#39;s searing guitar tones and harsh screams are still instantly recognizable today not to mention the progressively intense burst beat approach that sets liturgy apart from pretty much anything going on in the underground past and present as it contributes to the transcendental effect of being lifted up into a Heavenly Rapture now these themes have remained pretty key to liturgy sound for a long time now but hendrickx has built upon them pretty radically in both a musical and conceptual sense first off liturgy doesn&amp;#39;t just exist to be in opposition to something else just as hendrix&amp;#39;s pamphlet manifestos have grown into a full blown YouTube lecture series but liturgy&amp;#39;s music has now expanded to include more classical orchestrations experimental glitches Avant gard and Progressive song structures and the concepts have gotten so high the last record origin of the alimonies attempted to put an operatic narrative on some of the inner workings of hendrix&amp;#39;s theological worldview so we&amp;#39;re at a point now liturgy just kind of exists in a universe that is of its own making and is working off a growing series of self-references that raise the stakes higher with each album because regardless of how many charts and dissertations and theories a given liturgy album is couched in it is pretty clear that Hendrick does try to outdo herself in some sense every time we get an album cycle either that or she&amp;#39;s making more and more fevered attempts to cross over into the spirit realm using music so I went into 936 96 curious to see how Hendrick would take liturgy to a higher plane once again especially since our first taste of this album was its 14 minute and 52 second title track meanwhile the entire record itself uh nears 90 minutes in length and I&amp;#39;m not going to lie is colorful and as rich as some of this record&amp;#39;s instrumental palletes were it was a bit of a challenge and an adjustment even to somebody who has historically really messed with this project maybe because it&amp;#39;s been a while since I&amp;#39;ve really had a sit down with with a liturgy album but simultaneously the density and volume of this record leaves the listener with a lot to pull apart hanging on to every notable change throughout the first major piece on the project generation can be a bit like a focused tight RPP walk but like usual I think Hendrick may be acutely aware of how this wall this onslaught of unrelenting drums and guitars can sound for long spans of time which is why she usually works in some lighter gentler musical passages here and there which function as necessary moments to breathe on the album yes but also complement this record&amp;#39;s compositional progression as well be it through the wful vocal meditation on the intro track daily bread or the large Heavenly Coral passages on Angel of sovereignty Red Crown 2 is a gentle little woodwind piece that also functions as one of many musical callbacks to older liturgy releases on the record further adding to the sense that 9369 6 is a culmination of everything that this band has been working on so far for example the closing track of mortal Life 2 is a sparkling little rendition of some of the melody passages from the title track that came off of the debut EP uh from liturgy and it&amp;#39;s kind of amazing to compare these two pieces because the harsh and distorted production and sequence Drums of of one and then the twinkling layers of very refined instrumentation on the other it&amp;#39;s not just night and day they sound like different eras of human existence this album is also broken up into four major movements those would be sovereignty hierarchy emancipation and individuation and there&amp;#39;s ATT track and tribute to the Angelic representative of each movement too be that angel of individuation which is handily the most ambitious and beautiful of them with its very high-rising orchestrations then angel of sovereignty and so on and I would say each of these moments makes for a pretty beautiful highlight on the project and shows just how far Hendrick has come as a composer and a ranger over the years so all of this is a lot and makes 9369 a difficult record to assess succinctly uh also an album that&amp;#39;s hard to judge based on the merits of its songs individually because it&amp;#39;s all really functioning together as this massive High concept art piece which is also trying to retrospectively re-evaluate and rejuvenate uh its entire catalog up until this point still I figure I should try to break out a little bit some of the larger louder and more overwhelming moments on the project like the previously mentioned generation which slides very nicely into the following Kyla this track hits with some mountainous and panoramic layers of keys and strings and drums right off the bat all of which ring through pretty clear the drums are especially crisp I&amp;#39;m not surprised to hear the one and only Steve Albini is on recording and production credits this time around as the percussion does sound like it was captured in a gigantic room the composition from this point is interesting it is a roller coaster of marching snares winding lead Melodies and mathematical grooves working out progressions and builds that push a little bit further and higher with each time that they repeat and evolve we eventually get a breakdown with some electronic beats that introduces some new melodic themes that are then worked upon this Middle Point continues to keep me on the edge of my seat and then we eventually hit a finale that ushers in some of the most grand and righteous string layers in red on the entire LP there&amp;#39;s quite a bit of drama to it too between the chord changes and uh the chorus vocals in the background I feel like I&amp;#39;m witnessing a powerful revelation of some sort so it makes quite a bit of sense that the lyrics on the song Speak to uh some kind of spiritual Transcendence the following Kyla makes its mark on the lp with some gorgeous passages of pagy piano leads singing Woodwinds as well that soar above these crushing riffs the Glitchy breakdowns in the final moments of the song make for a killer finish too and there&amp;#39;s the next major piece on the project Hogan 2 which hits with some exhilarating crescendos and burst beat passages in the first leg and eventually introduces this very intense passage of rumbling progressive metal top with what sounds like a robotic prayer or chanting going on it&amp;#39;s very mesmerizing these separate sections that Define the first portion of the song Eventually kind of come together in a way in an even grander series of melodic ascents and builds that have me wondering how high can this go up how far can this go and it&amp;#39;s hendrix&amp;#39;s compositional foresight that allows for I guess the illusion that uh it really could go on forever because she really is able to at least on some of these songs create this sensation of infinity which depending on how impatient and attentive of a listener you are could be a good or bad thing I think the following before I knew the truth serves much the same purpose that Kyla did in this portion of the album it&amp;#39;s kind of like a very visceral and ornate Chaser after such a huge multiphased prag metal experience there&amp;#39;s a lot of keys and thunderous double kicks and beautiful vocal harmonies I am a little split on some of the vocal passages here though because they&amp;#39;re uh delivered with this kind of uh uh tamber which I&amp;#39;m not as into as some of the more full-throated singing throughout this record which you can hear an example of at the start of the song Anon the rest of which has its moments with some really pounding Rift passages which are good but maybe not as exhilarating as the album&amp;#39;s gigantic title track which is long but I think works as a perfect distillation of liturgy&amp;#39;s current sound you have those thick layers of tremolo guitars the muscular drumming the headbanging riffs riding uh very angular and pronounced grooves the shrill screams and the ringing metallic tones and keys skipping glitches too and multiple phases on this track some of which which are introduced by these really cool bass breakdowns the last 3 minutes of the track too feels like a bold Improvement on the metal Orchestra fusions that we heard throughout the track hack in 2019 it&amp;#39;s an incredible moment on the lp that will undoubtedly take anybody listening to it a while to process but uh believe me when I say it&amp;#39;s worth every second of its 14-minute runtime but that is not all because before this record is done it it gives us another 14-minute piece with antigon two which yes does kick off with those vocal inflections I&amp;#39;m not super crazy about some of the chord changes and riffs are quite sour and tense as well and the way they syn up with the drums feels maybe a bit too loose but the track does eventually Branch off into some really visceral and heavy prag metal passages some burning tremolo guitar layers as well with what sounds like some bow double Bas and maybe some horn layers calling out in the background either way the instrument Passages at this point sound like a smoldering hellscape but funnily enough once the drums kick in it kind of sounds like a call back to a much earlier liturgy recording like something from the re Annihilation era and that&amp;#39;s not a bad thing as later on in the piece it is very well complemented with these Boulder sized riff passages eily beautiful vocal harmonies too and the biggest orchestral presentation uh on the entire record at the very finish though it does come and go within a very brief span of time so while this piece in particular I don&amp;#39;t think uh starts as strong as it finishes I still think it does function as a pretty awe inspiring piece that encapsulates multiple eras of liturgy sound and just kind of collapses them on top of each other now as far as this record overall I loved it but still difficult project to sum up I&amp;#39;ll say as far as major flaws uh there were some tracks and passages that to me came off a little bloated unnecessarily lengthy and on top of it I&amp;#39;ll say this I do miss some of the grand operatic and classical orchestrations uh from the last record which I think in a way felt grander in comparison to a lot of moments I&amp;#39;m hearing here and I could see the argument that that record was maybe more of a detour and what this album here is doing is uh you know more building on the 2019 album I think that&amp;#39;s fair I think that&amp;#39;s fine but you know what I still think those classical and operatic elements were great they&amp;#39;re part of liturgy Cannon it would have been amazing to hear them come back in a bigger and more pronounced way this time around that being said though what is here is huge and is massive on its own the intensity the variety the builds the crescendos the everything across the entirety of this project is incredibly impressive just a really great as I said earlier culmination of everything that has made liturgy the very special and unique Rock and experimental music endeavor that it is the ambition and creative Aesthetics that hendrickx brings to the table through liturgy continue to be something to behold and interestingly I think a record like this really kind of opens up the floodgates for potentially a new sound a new Direction a new era because the past 10 plus years of liturgy just feel so well summed up here really in such a way where it&amp;#39;s difficult to imagine how they could be further expanded upon but yes as I said earlier I think This Record is fantastic loved it I&amp;#39;m feeling a strong A2 a light n on this

    "transcript": "and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new Lana Del Rey album did you know that there&amp;#39;s a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard this is the newest full-length LP from singer and songwriter Miss Lana Del Rey bringing us her lengthiest title on this album as well as her lengthiest run time at 77 minutes and I&amp;#39;ll say this Lana may not be one of my favorite artists period but she has been one of the most frequently reviewed on this channel cause there&amp;#39;s only a few artists I can say I&amp;#39;ve covered for like the eighth time in album reviews alone and at least for me and Lana&amp;#39;s catalog there&amp;#39;s been some Highs but a lot of lows up until this point too but the progression has mostly all been uphill as I think Lana&amp;#39;s chops and sensibilities as a singer and a songwriter have gotten better over the years her sense of adventure as an artist has increased too not only that but I think she&amp;#39;s done a great job of coming into her own because becoming more self-aware portraying herself in a more flattering compelling and authentic light and actually embodying the classic Americana Aesthetics that at one point in her career came across way more tacky creatively I think she really hit a peek with the record Norman [ __ ] Rockwell as many people do I think the following Chemtrails over the country club was mostly pleasurable as well but something did feel slightly off with her last full-length LP blue banisters while there was some likable content and songwriting on that one the performances and song structures were pretty blemished and drawn out I know historically Lana hasn&amp;#39;t been the strongest singer or anything like that but up until this point it seemed like she was making a genuine effort to just kind of keep her vocals and instrumentation more on point and interesting which is why I say Ocean Boulevard is actually a very nice bounce back because I think she&amp;#39;s hit another high on this one even if it does take some fans a bit to realize because this album is a very dense personal and I would say demanding release from Lana the production here and there may be a little too washed out yes but it&amp;#39;s mostly tasteful intimate and well balanced with plenty of strings and pianos some guitar too it may not be as groomed and Grand or densely arranged as NFR was which as a result of that that record May remain to be like the fan favorite just because of how big it is but there&amp;#39;s a lot of power on Ocean Boulevard too I would argue more power but soft power there&amp;#39;s an intimacy to this record it&amp;#39;s more organic it&amp;#39;s more open much in the same way blue banisters was but this time around the execution is so much better it&amp;#39;s more primped take what sounds like a super raw and one take vocal and piano performance on the song kitsugi as an example another thing that feels like a familiar carryover from Blue banisters is that in the finer details of that record Lana stowed away so many personal details about her life about her family and she revisit it&amp;#39;s a lot of those themes once again on Ocean Boulevard but this time in a much more overt way which is clear from the opening track the grants which is titled after her family name the music has this gorgeous hopeful angle to it with a gospel twist and lyrically features nods to her grandmother her sister&amp;#39;s baby she says on the track I&amp;#39;m doing this for us our family line she makes reference to her pastor on the track too so I guess in a way on this record she&amp;#39;s finding God a little bit which is also obvious from the Judah Smith interlude on this thing which is a weird moment on the record I should probably get out of the way now it&amp;#39;s essentially four minutes of this social media mega church leader giving a sermon talking about wanting and valuing and caring about the things in front of you be they your loved ones family your spouse also showing Wonder in the face of God&amp;#39;s creations and planet Earth it&amp;#39;s very passionate very convincing there&amp;#39;s almost a theater of the Mind element to it too where it sounds like this guy is at a distance like you&amp;#39;re hearing him from the furthest back pew in the church meanwhile this sermon is set to these winding piano passages and what sounds like Lana or some woman right next to me kind of uh politely laughing in support of a lot of the things the pastor is saying kind of saying yeah and just affirming what she&amp;#39;s hearing in one breath the track seems like it&amp;#39;s trying to be this moment of deep reflection but in another it feels like I&amp;#39;m experiencing a fever dream or a nightmare listening to this guy blow hot air over Cosmic Glory as he&amp;#39;s currently being sued by his Church&amp;#39;s employees for making tithing compulsory sounds like hell on Earth to me not to totally discount the track though because I do think it adds to the overall lore of this record because a lot of the narratives on these songs frame Lana as a woman who&amp;#39;s kind of caught between her sexual desires and her dark side but also this wish to be a proper beautiful respectable traditional woman I also think it says something that this interlude comes right after a w or American Horror which was a lead track to this record let&amp;#39;s talk about it this song is very much about Lana&amp;#39;s unending attraction to a very toxic and surface level relationships which has long been a central focus in many of her tracks and hits but I think this example over here is one of the most cutting as Lana kind of tortures herself over how self-aware of this problem she is going as far as to say she&amp;#39;s looking like a side piece at 33 even as a successful singer there are Deeper lyrics on the track that explore things like rape culture as well as a loss of innocence in youth which I think is also a pretty central theme of candy necklace but back to a w because there&amp;#39;s a really creative instrumental switch up toward the back end of the track too that feels like a totally different song and interlude itself where suddenly some synths and beats are introduced and a lot of attempts in the past are kind of mixing more organic and synthetic instrumentation I personally think have not gone super well but I think it truly Clicks in this instance especially since it adds to the track in such a conceptual way because with these rhythms we get all these sexy grooves we get the sounds of zippers on uh zippering a lot of surface level flirty bars and kind of baby voiced flows from Lana she&amp;#39;s delivering with this kind of sleepy drunken slurred inflection going on about being used by this Jimmy character in a way it feels like she&amp;#39;s channeling a more former self and really depicting in the best way she can this American Horror experience that she&amp;#39;s singing about in the chorus of a w making this in my opinion I&amp;#39;ll use this word again one of the most conceptual songs she&amp;#39;s ever dropped there are some interesting layers on the title track too which comes across super smooth and melodic despite it being one of her most verbose singles yet against very gentle and Moody pianos she makes demands like open me up tell me you like it [ __ ] me to death love me until I love myself which there&amp;#39;s a deeper meaning to outside of this very overcry for attention and affection as Lana Likens herself on this track to a now closed up like pedestrian tunnel underneath Ocean Boulevard that at one time was beloved and beautiful and used frequently but at this time currently is forgotten and old and phased out is it possible on this song that Lana is not feeling her strongest in terms of you know mainstream success or you know just uh popularity this also ties into Reflections on the track about her feeling kind of isolated and in her own world I don&amp;#39;t know how Hotel California Sounds like Florida but point taken Lana continues to build this elegant little character portrait on the song sweet as well which has one of the prettiest melodic runs on the entire record but is hilariously contrasted with harsh lines like I&amp;#39;m a different kind of woman if you want some basic [ __ ] go to the Beverly Center and find her but don&amp;#39;t worry Lana will wait for you to make up your mind until then she&amp;#39;ll be sweet and in bare feet as she says sounding like some kind of tick-tock Trad white fantasy do you want children do you want to marry me do you want to run marathons which I guess isn&amp;#39;t everyone&amp;#39;s picture of an ideal life but ultimately the track is an endearing ballad about building a life with another person toward the middle of the record we begin to get these songs that feel more like lengthy internal monologues like the previously mentioned kinsugi or the song fingertips where Lana sings through these very dense verses in a very open way going on about the well-being of her brother and sister asking does she have the mental stability to have her own child someday because it&amp;#39;s been said so she says that she doesn&amp;#39;t have that she sings about the death of her uncle but potentially taking her own life too there&amp;#39;s this recurring theme on the track about taking two seconds to stop or pause or breathe or think mostly before you have like a total and utter breakdown it&amp;#39;s not the strongest Direction song wise of all the tracks here but it&amp;#39;s still a compelling Whirlwind of emotions really Lana in the raw or sounding like she&amp;#39;s slowly descending into madness and sounding gripping in the process or lack thereof deeper into the track list the Moody ballads with striking Melodies continue be that on Paris Texas which is a wonderful and wintry number in 3-4 or let the light in which is an excellent acoustic cut featuring Father John Misty I just continue to love uh their little musical connection that they have and then there&amp;#39;s also grandfather please stand on the shoulders of my father while he&amp;#39;s deep sea fishing which very much sets the record straight on whether or not Lana has been kind of crafted or engineered as an artist or is essentially a controlled industry plant a puppet on strings fake to contrast this she tries her best to paint a genuine self-portrait in her lyrics on this one which reading it it&amp;#39;s valid and I understand that Lana is only human and rightfully upset about the ways in which she may have been painted in the past but In fairness her initial break into the Limelight wasn&amp;#39;t exactly a graceful one and the themes and shtick of her early records was pretty toxic plus she is also no stranger to putting her foot in her mouth but with that being said who she truly is I think comes through a lot better through her actions and through her music these days and what she&amp;#39;s saying on this track in terms of being an authentic artist is most definitely true because I do not think there is a music industry Focus Group in existence that would come up with a four-track run as unintentionally hilarious as Coachella Woodstock in my mind God Bless America and all the beautiful women in it when the world was at War we kept dancing and and Beautiful People beautiful problems having said that though I love the slowly intensifying instrumentation on this track it&amp;#39;s beautiful just mark this one down as another amazingly gorgeous Moment On The Record then from here we get a pretty interesting finish on Ocean Boulevard there&amp;#39;s Margaret featuring Jack antonoff&amp;#39;s bleachers Jack Antonoff multi-instrumentalist singer and songwriter he is a producer too and has worked with Lana in the past obviously was a main brain on her NFR record that so many people love I love you love uh and Margaret is a pretty striking moment on the record for me especially since it kind of feels like a closer narratively and instrumentally especially with those swelling vocals and strings and horns on the back end the singing is really loose almost like you&amp;#39;re experiencing a cast and crew from some kind of musical production coming together to wrap up a great performance there&amp;#39;s also a funny reference to antonov&amp;#39;s up and coming wedding date as as the song is about his fiancee there are also some funny self-references on the track especially toward the beginning as Lana is talking about writing the song and how she looks and how she&amp;#39;s writing the track for her friend The Haunting refrains throughout the track of when you know you know are gorgeous and hard-hitting uh tore me apart emotionally especially since they really bring home this idea that when you are in love you just don&amp;#39;t really need to think about it or rationalize as to why you just know there&amp;#39;s a fantastic verse from Jack on the track as well but from here from this point after Margaret is over the record almost feels like I&amp;#39;m experiencing a deluxe edition or something like Ocean Boulevard is done and over and now just has like a few odds and ends to dish out you have fishtail which is this really depressing and Atmospheric ballad with some beats in the background and what sounds like some light auto-tune on Lana&amp;#39;s voice it&amp;#39;s not super oppressive but nonetheless sort of unflattering maybe my least favorite moment here and then following this there Peppers which is kind of an attempt at a hip hop inspired crossover Lana has made tracks like these in the past specifically this one feels like it could have almost been on her Paradise EP from back in the day but the Aesthetics and overall mood and attitude this time around are a lot weirder and I kind of [ __ ] with it especially with Tommy genesis&amp;#39;s very sticky refrain on the track then there&amp;#39;s taco truck xvb which in the first leg comes across like it&amp;#39;s some kind of Born to Die throwback you have the beats the shitty relationship narrative um some of the worst lyrics on the record too oh that&amp;#39;s why they call me lanita when I get down I&amp;#39;m Bonita the track eventually phases into this instrumental passage and becomes like a demo version or alternate version of the song Venice [ __ ] with a lot of synths and booming beats it&amp;#39;s okay not as great as the original single version fans are familiar with it&amp;#39;s almost like Lana purposefully regresses to a former self in the final moments of this LP which given that it is Lana Del Rey and she has a deep love of nostalgia there could be a million and one reasons and motivations as to why she&amp;#39;s doing that I guess it just would have been nice if she conceptualized it a bit more that being said the first 13 cuts on this thing are amazing they&amp;#39;re fantastic in my opinion nearly Flawless Lana&amp;#39;s best work yet her finest crop of songs good production good instrumentation the lyrical content at the core of these tracks is personal it is detailed it is thoughtful it is moving it&amp;#39;s also pretty low on cliches as far as the Lana average plus these tracks didn&amp;#39;t really need a whole lot of dolling up instrumentally because how catchy and emotionally potent they are comes across regardless of how many strings are piled on top of them I&amp;#39;ll also add this record is really the best application features on any line of Records so far too the John Batiste contributions are especially fire I&amp;#39;ll reiterate the ending moments are a little odd and not entirely necessary but I&amp;#39;m not mad they&amp;#39;re here either they do kind of add to the Mythos of this record in a way and Lana&amp;#39;s progression as an artist over the years I don&amp;#39;t want to belabor my thoughts on this album any further I think it&amp;#39;s great I genuinely think Lana did a wonderful job on this one she knocked it out of the [ __ ] Park I&amp;#39;m feeling a light too decent nine on this thing

    "transcript": "uh hi everyone booth and he&amp;#39;s scared Tano here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new Danny Brown and jpeg Mafia project scaring the hose This Record is a collaboration between two of the underground&amp;#39;s most beloved rappers at the moment Danny Brown and jpeg Mafia which is hilariously titled scaring the hoes which yes is obviously a joke but so ingeniously fitting for their respective approaches to hip-hop music for those who are out of the know the idea of scaring the hose is pretty common vernacular in internet music circles used to describe music that has kind of a weirdo slant to it or just isn&amp;#39;t very widely appealing maybe out of some insecurity-based fear that you would get weird stares from women or just harsh the general Vibe which I think says a lot about where this phrase comes from but with the internet effectively collapsing the mainstream and Underground on top of each other there&amp;#39;s this increasingly unignorable truth that some new music just doesn&amp;#39;t succeed based on its pop appeal or being easy listening and I think few artists out there understand that as well as Danny Brown and jpeg Mafia at one point in the early 2010s Danny Brown was seen as one of the biggest Oddities in rap with absolutely unhinged Rhymes loaded with dark and raunchy content plus his yelpie vocal inflections and left field production choices all of which still make him an instantly recognizable figure in today&amp;#39;s rap landscape even more than 10 years after his breakout mixtape XXX jpeg Mafia on the other hand his blow up came a bit later with the release of 2018&amp;#39;s Veteran and in the last five years he shown himself to also be a groundbreaking and unique Oddball these guys recently did a podcast together hyping up the release of this record and in the midst of it Danny jokingly admitted to feeling like Peggy was going to replace him when he first got into his music and as he continues to grow his brand and his craft it&amp;#39;s not hard to see why jpeg would be the Envy of other artists generally he is kind of a triple threat perhaps he sings he produces all of his major projects thus far just ooze creativity and despite his genuinely unorthodox approach to rhyme schemes and song structures he actually has a lot of super catchy tracks out there but being catchy does not seem to be the name of the game on scaring the hose which is definitely more than just a funny title because in practice on this thing Danny and Peggy Embrace some of their most out there creative ideas take the title track for example whose beat kicks off with these really loud and aggressive slapping sounds which at first I thought was just clapping and it may very well be but if it is like man those are some loud wet and Meaty hands and as the entire instrumental kicks and we get booming drums rumbling bass and these lengthy horn chops that sound like a saxophone slowly dying I wouldn&amp;#39;t say it&amp;#39;s a walk in the park as far as Vibe goes but I suppose I would feel somewhat cheated if a song titled scaring the hoes sounded like it was gunning to be a top 40 hit of course Danny and Peggy on the track trade distorted bars about feeling out of step with current trends and pressures to make something that has more of a pop appeal and honestly for a record like this I would say we have a perfect mission statement in terms of Danny and Peggy putting forward their artistic intent here which mind you these guys have always been clear about be it in the way Dany is stuck to his trademark vocal delivery over the years or the way Peggy proudly flies his freak flag and boasts about being difficult to compare or categorize on the song step a pig and does it over one of the most unique beats I&amp;#39;ve heard this year and it&amp;#39;s insane he produced these tracks on an SP 404 which is a pretty legendary machine as far as hip-hop production goes a lot of Classics have been pumped out on this thing but many current day producers prefer the freedom and versatility that a digital audio workstation on a computer offers instead but yeah it says on the bandcamp page for this record that the 404 was pretty strictly used in the creation of this project project but it also says that Peggy is now done using the 404 now which I&amp;#39;m sure again has its limitations and its difficulties but it didn&amp;#39;t stop Peggy from very precisely layering these sparkling cinferons tight bass lines and beautiful vocal harmonies on this beat I&amp;#39;m even more Blown Away by the production on Garbage Pail Kids which assembles the sounds of children chanting metallic perks this really loose ass Rhythm and these fat fat hits of bass there&amp;#39;s also this genuinely heart-wrenching Sun scorched series of guitar chords that sound equally wretched and gorgeous one of my favorite Danny verses on the project also turns up on this track there&amp;#39;s a line where he references uh this cannabis bar about eating ass and He audibly makes himself laugh as he does it without a doubt Danny&amp;#39;s as wild as he&amp;#39;s ever been on this record the creative and uncompromising bangers continue deeper into the track list there&amp;#39;s the fantastic break beat switches and Q little synth Court passages on fentanyl tester where Danny gets a huge chance to shine lyrically which I&amp;#39;m happy about given how short his contribution was to the first teaser track from this thing lean beef patty going into this I feared there wouldn&amp;#39;t really be a lot of space for Danny on the lp but listening to the entire thing there&amp;#39;s actually plenty even going halves with Peggy lyrically on the two-parter shut your ass up and Muddy Waters the track Burfict which was also a highlight for me features these insane horn samples which sounds like Danny and Peggy are having a rap battle dressed as Gladiators in the Roman Coliseum I guarantee this track has one of the most amazing beats you&amp;#39;ll hear this year from here we move into a pretty strong second half though there are some shorter and undercooked cuts that don&amp;#39;t feel quite as detailed or as amped as some of the best moments thus far namely Orange Juice Jones and run the jewels but there&amp;#39;s also the Heavenly sample heavy number Kingdom Hearts key which sounds very much like it could have been a highlight on Peggy&amp;#39;s last record with the unique song progression the melodious sample chops as well as Peggy&amp;#39;s charismatic delivery on the front end the records loan feature turns up on this song too the young and up and coming rapper red Veil who actually has one of the more standout verses on this project in terms of a performance and energy he brings to the table he really has like the fire in his belly of a young Tyler the Creator on this one the descending bass lines and enveloping gospel samples on God loves you is also just classic jpeg all the way and this beat is perfectly paired with bars from Danny that have loads of a very filthy religious and biblical nods the gospel Vibes come back even better on the track heaven on Earth with some Tangy organs and lots of huge Coral hits Jack Harlow combo meal features some of the nuttiest Jazz rap you&amp;#39;ll ever hear on planet Earth in one breath it is smooth in the way some of the best stuff in this genre typically is but there&amp;#39;s a very left field chaos to it that feels super specific to Dany and jpeg then the closer I would say is one of the more difficult listens on the lp with a very quirky thin Rhythm hanging in the background which is matched with these crushing walls of bass and keys some fuzzed out samples to chaotically flying into the mix in every direction and with that track this thing ends aggressively abruptly and in a very disorderly fashion definitely leaving the hose scared and maybe even scarred I&amp;#39;m feeling a light nine on this LP yeah it rules transition have you given this record a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should I review next hit the like if you like Please Subscribe and please don&amp;#39;t cry hit the Bell as well over here next

    "transcript": "hi everyone it&amp;#39;s a Thanksgiving Miracle here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new Ash Inspire record hostile architecture this is the sophomore full-length LP of Scottish band Ash inspire a group that formed around 2013 dropped a debut album in 2017 and now five years later we have this sophomore record I am just now hearing of the band through the cell pay their last one didn&amp;#39;t really seem to stir up that much attention this one is on the band camp platform and Beyond and uh just from spinning the first track of it it&amp;#39;s not hard to see why that would be the song The Law of asbestos which is this aggressive blend of black metal Jazz and prog rock topped with feral thickly accented rants there&amp;#39;s a bridge in the second half as well which is hugely post Rock influenced with weeping strings as well as desperately shouted poetry about the unlivable conditions faced by the unhoused and impoverished with mentions of breaths of asbestos as well as homeless spikes despite this not really being an instrumental record it&amp;#39;s already godspeed-esque in my view given that we have a classical veneer over all these underground rock styles coming together also taking into account the political leanings expressed on this record of the large Collective of instrumentation presented and since the days of godspeed You black Emperors Heyday I can only think of a few bands that have made similarly bold takedowns of poverty especially one that whittles the topical Focus down to architectural Corner cutting a soundtrack by black metal style blast beats so yeah this track this band This Record is unique out of the gate to say the least and from the beginning of the second song on this LP it&amp;#39;s a holistic flow begins to establish itself because given how Relentless and angry the opener is the mid-paced riffs here and thicker mix just kind of makes sense the change in pacing and momentum it just comes off as very complementary but the lyrical themes here have switched to something that is an even darker arguably the generational or even hereditary inheritance of misogyny with some astrological tie-ins On lyrics as well the front man has some Choice words for Orion at some point toward the end which get kind of blood curdling if you couldn&amp;#39;t already tell I&amp;#39;m pretty impressed with the Poetry on this thing and as if the band&amp;#39;s versatility wasn&amp;#39;t already impressive here comes the track Platinum belt Persephone Praxis whose second half Embraces almost a minimalist Vibe with all these repeating and solely intensifying bits of reeds drums guitars strings as well and gets quite hypnotic even as we explode into these bits of blast beats toward the end what the band is bringing to the table here is maybe not the most novel thing on the planet as I recall bands and projects such as liturgy playing with a similar array of influences but Ash Inspire certainly has their own play on it of course also the performance on this track is great the band is sounding tight and the lyrics are pretty devastating as well depicting the demoralizing and soul-sucking grind of everyday life the way living joylessly on the economic Edge can drive one into a stimulant-fueled Insanity following this there&amp;#39;s how the mighty have Vision which is a fantastic Coral piece with an operatic Edge to it much of the instrumentation stripped back and I like that not only is this track beautiful stunning and dramatic but it provides a nice break from much of the heaviness of the rest of the album then from here the tracklist offers some mid-sized cuts to fill out the latter half there&amp;#39;s tragic heroine which features a lot of very hypnotic Prague and black metal inspired riffs that reminds me of one of the last like altar of plague&amp;#39;s Records some fluttering strings as well that occasionally lock in with the Melodies of the lead vocals and this song essentially feels like a very aggressive storm to match the calm of the previous cut and I think instrumentally the band is trying to do their best to inspire an Awakening here at least that&amp;#39;s how it comes across in the lyrics as much of the Poetry on this cut boils down to those who are living below the poverty line or in the gutter coming together to realize their Collective power there is a similar sentiment voiced as well on the track apathy as arsenic lethargy as lead where some of the sharpest social points on the entire project are made depicting not only a working class hoping to not be pulled further under by A system that is set to work against them I also think the palette of metal and Jazz instrumentation kind of coming together reminds me of bands such as Imperial triumphant in the best way possible following this on track seven we have an okay instrumental song outside of the bits of horns and strings here and there chord progression wise Melody wise it kind of sounds like a song that would end up on some random metalcore bands EP as a show that&amp;#39;s a hey we can get kind of emotional and dynamic two guys like it&amp;#39;s not awful but definitely mediocre in comparison with everything that has led up until this point still I guess I can give the song props for uh being a bit of a setup for the final track here cable street again an incredible finish to this record which is kind of difficult to sum up honestly as it is the longest and most complicated song here in terms of its lyrical nuances its compositional nuances it&amp;#39;s multiple phases the Relentless black metal inspired guitars and drums in the first leg are fantastic the chilling keys and lyrics that sound like they are being delivered through a weeping in the act of the second act right after that are stunning as well from here we eventually reach a final leg that paints a very ugly present day picture impending fascism A system that is not broken but working as intended one of the most devastating parts of the whole thing is this touch of meta commentary uh where it is sung if this is against the grain meaning all all the points being made up until this point then the blight has really set in which is a pretty strong point to make because I think in moments of peril such as these the only thing that can really Doom US is an acceptance of everything that&amp;#39;s going on as a normal or okay one more part of the track that hits the hardest is the very very very ending which not only does so because of the incredible uh instrumental performance up until this point but it&amp;#39;s parting words there&amp;#39;s no Middle Road and I tell you get down off the fence before the barbed wire comes up that is a pretty strong warning uh after a very strong album in my opinion from the immense and tight and fantastic performances to the writing to the song structures to the uh well arranged layers of instrumentation to the lyrical Focus to the conceptual ambition of this entire thing that lasts from end to end this is a truly stellar and amazing album from a band that frankly uh before a few weeks ago I just never heard of before proof that great work from relatively unknown artists is out there online if you&amp;#39;re willing to dig for it and hopefully you guys give this record a shot and find much of the same Beauty and excitement in it that I did feeling a light to decent 9 on this one transition have you given this record a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate

    "score": 9,
    "date": "October 28, 2022",
    "genre": "Chamber Folk",
    "transcript": "uh hi everyone flamatarian here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new Natalia lafourcade record De todas Las Flores this is the latest full-length LP from one of Mexico&amp;#39;s best who is quickly following up the two volume experience that she released last year uncanto por Mexico which featured loads of songs instrumental palettes and guest artists that allowed Natalya to explore her Mexican heritage musically speaking in a profound way with higher production value than she had ever had before while these are not my favorite projects she has released thus far there still are a lot of amazing songs on these records I definitely came away from these LPS admiring their ambition even if that ended up uh giving us some instrumentals that felt maybe a bit too sanitized or methodically produced and put together to the point where it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s super clean like something out of a Disney soundtrack which is not entirely surprising given Natalia&amp;#39;s connections to the Disney friend franchise but historically at least for me it&amp;#39;s her more rustic records that end up really doing it for me that is what I get the most out of and de todos Las Flores is one of those records but this record simultaneously continues to show the instrumental ambition that we heard on Natalya&amp;#39;s past couple of albums but now the performances and the orchestrations feel much more loose and Lively wild and exciting it&amp;#39;s a bold and beautiful record and a really thorough one too considering the 12 tracks on this thing span over an hour in run time there are also a good handful of songs on this thing that push past six minutes easily thanks to some really patient intros extended instrumental passages as well as just a lot of great chemistry between Natalia and her band the whole thing just feels very lightning in a bottle especially during moments like when Natalya&amp;#39;s vocals are hitting on the first vocal line of vinay Solita which not only sounds very beautiful and intimate yes but you can also hear the sound of her voice bouncing off the walls of the room she&amp;#39;s recording it which is also the case to a lesser degree for some of the other instrumentation too it&amp;#39;s kind of like you&amp;#39;re sitting in on a really cool studio session for the album and let me say sonically the record is engineered beautifully it sounds so freaking good and clear and well balanced even through a phone speaker I could even make out the upright bass super clearly like whoever engineered this thing is a  God because again everything going on on this LP translates so well even though there are spots and Pockets that are meant to be a little chaotic and a little messy as far as the musical style of this LP is concerned it&amp;#39;s not too much unlike Natalia&amp;#39;s most recent works it&amp;#39;s a mixed bag of Bops and ballads that touch down on numerous shades of Latin music but a super versatile band allows her to take these Styles and fuse them a little bit with elements of chamber music and Jazz but honestly one of the best things about this record isn&amp;#39;t so much Natalya playing musical Anthropologist or curator as she has on previous records because I think de todos Las Flores plays more toward emotion than anything else truly because the feelings on this record at least for me are so incredibly potent much more than any album she&amp;#39;s released thus far in this vein like with the intimacy and heart-wrenching power found in the subtlety of the opener I think the beauty of Natalya&amp;#39;s voice on this track should be enough to bring anyone to their knees the hypnotizing title tracks sweet vocal Melodies and subtle little grooves make me feel like I am having a passionate Tango session going on in my head plus the way the background instrumentation and vocal harmonies uh swell and grow along the progression of the track it&amp;#39;s so incremental that by the time it&amp;#39;s like fully on you&amp;#39;re barely even realizing what&amp;#39;s going on and you&amp;#39;re just kind of engrossed in it there&amp;#39;s also the devastating sadness of pasandos Dias the endlessly dramatic tension of ivame viento which begins simply as many cuts on this LP do but gradually the entire track turns into this beautiful and cacophonous rainfall of percussion piano acoustic guitar horns the second half sees it all coalescing into kind of a loose linear Groove I wish this portion of the song had a stronger I guess a 0.8 point B to it it ends a little inconsequentially meanwhile El Lugar correcto is a passionate and methodically performed number meant for the dance floor lots of orchestration surrounding it too this is one of a few tracks that feels very close aesthetically to many songs on uh uncanto but the final production touches don&amp;#39;t come across as being too stiff or too clean or over produced also the track Camina Bonito scratches a similar itch too pajarito Colibri is a beautiful and gentle number that is as graceful as the hummingbird the song is about the weepy little Melodies on the chorus are some of the catchiest on the entire record too and then the grooves return in a big way on Maria la conendera this track instrumentally emotionally burning it&amp;#39;s sultry the piano guitar and Horn parts are so hot you&amp;#39;re gonna sweat and I guess it makes sense given the metaphorical lyrics on the cut about dealing with pain having it burn away fire taking away that pain and then new flowers or opportunities or hopes or life kind of growing in a place of that the chilling spoken word passages all over Muerte are very much about the various things that Natalia has learned from Death uh her own mortality that kind of influencing her to value and think about life differently this portion of the track stands out is very unique and tense in comparison with the rest of the record however I do love how it really comes together with the background vocal harmonies and gets much sweeter and more harmonious in the second half the band&amp;#39;s really cooking on this one too with some of those horn and piano improvs meanwhile the dancing upright bass line as well as the little horn embellishments on Canta La Arena make this track a light and sweet contrast from the previous one for the closer we have a super sweet acoustic number that sends the album off with the most gentle of touches songwriting wise this one is not sticking with me as much as many other cuts on the record but I suppose was you know as a mood as a Vibe as a sentiment which again I think this album is just very much about that we haven&amp;#39;t quite Hit Upon something like this yet at this point in the track list and I suppose if you were going to feature this kind of feeling it works best toward the end give us a calm after this incredible incredible run of tracks honestly but yeah um this is quickly becoming one of my favorite Natalia records uh period even with the muses albums being as amazing as they were like for me this album is truly like top five of the Year material easily it&amp;#39;s that stunning it&amp;#39;s that gorgeous it&amp;#39;s that well performed it&amp;#39;s that well put together it is that deeply cutting emotionally and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just that it&amp;#39;s just that pretty it&amp;#39;s just that pretty but yeah absolutely loving this a couple of moments here and there that I was not super crazy about the the way they progressed but outside of that fire record fire album um again one of one of Natalia&amp;#39;s best one of the best of the a year and would easily give this thing a decent too strong nine transition have you given this album well listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should I review next hit the like if you like Please Subscribe and please don&amp;#39;t cry hit the Bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to

    "transcript": "hi everyone story mode here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new jit album The forever story this is a new LP from Georgia rapper and dreamville&amp;#39;s top spitter jid his long-awaited follow-up to his DiCaprio 2 project in 2018 one of my favorite records of that year really brought a lot of impressive tracks flows and bars to the table and the thing about jid that I think makes him stand out is he lets his massive amount of talent just speak for itself he&amp;#39;s not one of these overly competitive lyrical Miracle rappers trying to save the game yet he has plenty of clever wordplay to flex he also brings plenty of unique flows on his records without sounding overly pretentious or like his head is up his ass he has the taste and tact to appeal not just a more Discerning listeners but also people who are just looking to hear a banger too and not only is he plenty great as is but he also has a massive amount of potential which I and many have been hoping to hear him capitalize on on this record and and I would say he absolutely did that because [ __ ] there&amp;#39;s not a bad track on this thing and for sure coming away from this record there still will be doubters who make dismissive comparisons to the likes of Kendrick Lamar or Andre 3000 those people are just denying themselves the privilege of listening to a fantastic rapper come into his own on this LP because not only do we see improvements in jid&amp;#39;s delivery flows pen game here but we also get quite a bit of lyrical focus on many of these tracks the boldest and grandest production choices of jit&amp;#39;s career so far too crazy beat switches multi-phased songs strong choruses strong guest appearances from the likes of Ari Lennox Kenny Mason James Blake Yasin Bay and Lil Wayne too and jit is really treating us with all the freaking tracks on this project too 14 of them plus an intro they are all really robust cuts that span an hour in total we have radar that hits with these really fat 808s and high hats that skip across the beat like uh something out of a Brooklyn drill song This combined with its flows makes for a blistering intro and I love how even when going hard jid continues to just sound smooth calm collected not too smooth though as he still brings a very Dynamic delivery changing up his inflection every once in a while his flow and giving us lyrical gems with a crazy rhyme scheme such as Mirror Mirror why the [ __ ] is he laughing dear deer let me volunteer because I&amp;#39;m not in fear I&amp;#39;m gonna jump in the ashes Dance Now is a great teaser to the record still sounds fantastic in the context of the album we have a relaxed trap beat on this one with a killer spiritual Melody looping in the background many of jid&amp;#39;s bars here work as a clever self-portrait plus we get cold-blooded gems like they&amp;#39;re gonna let that Beretta fly cause you guys bugging spray pesticide this track is just engulfed engulfed in flames and I haven&amp;#39;t even mentioned the mean inflection that jid hits the pre-chorus with which works as a really nice contrast from Kenny Mason&amp;#39;s Song harmonies right after on crack sandwich we have a lot of spooky and somewhat animated Melodies worked into a classic boom bat beat there are plenty of one-liners on this one but much of the focus on this cut goes back to jid&amp;#39;s upbringing and his family and his Youth and how all these things shaped him into the artiste he is today the verses here touchdown on a few different points in his life a few different experiences but it all comes to a very chaotic head where he describes a whole like fighting Onslaught going on where he has to stand up for his sister it&amp;#39;s not a linear narrative but thematically it all kind of comes full circle in the end which is kind of the case for this record overall too can&amp;#39;t Punk me is really all about the hype and electricity that can lyrically be generated between jid and Earth Gang within a three minute span pull out the pumpkin Punk me [ __ ] pull out the pumpkin puppy [ __ ] it does not disappoint these three guys go insane on the song [ __ ] insane surround sound with baby Tate and 21 Savage was also a great teaser to this LP still sounds fantastic here in essence this song is a nod to most deaf especially with this sample here that many will remember was all also used on Miss fat booty but don&amp;#39;t worry most staff or Yasin Bay is also featured on this record later God and jid the way he switches up his flow every few bars it&amp;#39;s so natural and yet the changes are so strong and radical it&amp;#39;s kind of crazy it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s happening before my ears but I don&amp;#39;t notice it but it&amp;#39;s so uh impressive I think it just speaks to jid&amp;#39;s incredible amount of just natural talent because most people rapping this intensely or with this this much thought going into their lyrics usually sound like they&amp;#39;re trying a bit harder but this man does not even sound like he&amp;#39;s breaking a sweat and plus again with the flow switches does he ever run out of flow ideas does he run out of them 21 Savage keeps up on the track really nicely and uh baby Tate is fine she brings some smooth vocal passages on the cut which bring us to a very cool slo-mo outro where jid does uh even more amazing things lyrically I guess I just wish coming away from this track that baby Tate had a larger more lyrical feature because obviously she&amp;#39;s a very capable rapper too but yeah half the song proves anything is that jid is always going to switch things up and he is never going to stagnate on a track ever in fact he just refuses to do it even on the calm focused and beautiful Cody blue 31 the selling point of this track is really these stunning gorgeous group vocals but also jit is singing on the track too and not just like singing a little bit like singing fantastically singing very well better than some people who these days are trying to pass themselves off it&amp;#39;s like pop artists or r b artists seems like uh that&amp;#39;s a lane that jid could Explore More posts This Record but yeah throughout this cut we have a lot of moving lyrics about perseverance and jid&amp;#39;s experiences with that feeling and with that need to strive or that necessity to survive through his loved ones like his mother this all culminates into a super powerful Moment On The Record no doubt next the track list ingeniously delivers uh brought in them and system them back to back the former of those two tracks being very much focused on brotherhood friendship devotion it&amp;#39;s a bit of a slow burner but jid&amp;#39;s heartfelt bars and dynamic delivery keeps it really engaging from front to back there is a strong little Dirk feature on the cut too the latter of these two tracks features some pulsating synthesizers and a groovy beat that helps it hit a very hypnotic stride as do the chilling and gorgeous vocal harmonies from James Blake the metamorphosis of this bee is fantastic too as is the emotional metamorphosis of jid in the lyrics rapping about being there for his family and wanting to be the kind of man that his loved ones still Revere and not letting his fame or success or various Temptations take away from his Integrity following this we have the Stellar can&amp;#39;t make you change featuring Ari Lennox Ari&amp;#39;s vocals on the track are fantastic the whole cut has this luscious wonderful laid-back Soul quality to it the fat drums the fat bass and and while Ari does take up a bulk of the song at least in the first leg that is not a bad thing vocally she brings a nice change of pace to the record and hearing her sings always a treat jid though of course has some clever bars about being stuck in your ways chain changing in a sort of romantic context and he Dives even further into some Sour relationship bars after a beat switch in the second half and this section of the song is so good it could honestly be its own freaking song but that&amp;#39;s just where jit is at on this record he is so full of side ideas his songs have songs within them which is also the case for stars now admittedly I do think this is one of the weaker cuts on the lp especially with this very tedious beat that I don&amp;#39;t think jid&amp;#39;s lyrical efforts do enough to close the gap on but the track does finish with this sudden Interruption uh like this announcement message and now a word from our ancestors and then it goes into a great guest verse from Yasin Bay which again if extended feels like it could have been its own song and is just a fantastic addition to the record generally on just in time with Lil Wayne Wheezy brings one of his best guest verses in a while clearly he knew what he was getting into on a jid album and hearing these two side by side really does illustrate uh how well jit embodies uh his Wayne influence he also gives us an extra lyrical helping on the back end of the track too who the hell says the third verse is dead now from here we have a really strong ending on the record the track money is a highlight with this cute kids chorus sampled throughout the track nice beat nice descending chord progression whole song kind of feels like it could be something off an MF Doom record I think jit is consciously doing his best to channel that energy as well especially when he&amp;#39;s writing things in kind of a silly tone and rapping in in the third person better days sees jid going down memory lane again thematically one more impressive track on this thing in terms of flows in terms of production and lyrically he really ties up a lot of the records themes about growth becoming a different person becoming a better person and how your life experiences shape you and with Lotter 2 jid saved some of his best and most impressive rapping for last where we have this very tight beat and Speedy driving bass line that jid&amp;#39;s flows lock in with very very nicely incredible Sound Idea execution these fireworks flows really end the record off with a bang an intense one and the only thing more intense than the performance here is the messaging of this song where jid touches down on a lot of things but I think most specifically the exploitation of black voices and Artistry where he frames himself as putting in all of this work especially into the things he says in his records and yet that message is not translating it is not Landing in the way that he likes and uh yeah that is a story that is uh pretty well known at this point I would say in many ways the forever story that we are essentially locked into in the title here and taking this whole record into perspective I think that&amp;#39;s exactly what jid is doing on this LP is delivering unto us a lot of ideas themes and feelings that we&amp;#39;ve heard on Plenty of conscious hip-hop records in the past but he&amp;#39;s putting his own Spin and perspective on it with the experience that only an artist could at his age and with his knowledge level of those who came before him and there is a sadness and a futility in that repetition in that endless repetition that I think he&amp;#39;s going on about here but simultaneously the gospel inspired group vocals at the end of the track do present almost like a ray of Hope in that light not only do I see the forever story as just a really impressive showing of jid&amp;#39;s rapping abilities writing abilities uh songwriting abilities production choices but this album also functions as a tribute to the long-running history of more left field and conscious style hip-hop albums but now just delivering a lot of those thoughts and ideas in only the way an artist of jid&amp;#39;s generation could feeling a decent too strong nine on this one transition have you given this record a

    "transcript": "me from this prison hi everyone destiny mid-channel here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new black midi album hellfire this is a brand new lp from uk experimental rock prague rock noise rock avant rock outfit black midi it&amp;#39;s their third full length at this point and follows last year&amp;#39;s cavalcade which was one of the strongest and most exciting rock records of that year also showed the band graduating from some of their post-punk roots a little bit into again more progressive and avant-garde music in a way that was a lot flashier more technical more ambitious and we&amp;#39;re getting all of that plus even more on this new project which is another very tight and no bs experience 10 tracks one of them being an intro and the middle point of the record we have an interlude whole thing runs 39 minutes not a whole lot of room for filler but even with this record not being as expansive or as lengthy as some progressive or avant-garde albums are it still feels very much like an experience and i mean that in the sincerest way possible and god damn last year a lot of people were really like up my ass over the cavalcade review because i didn&amp;#39;t enjoy it as much as some of the fans did though i still loved it loved it but still felt like this record was just the beginning of something and that the band could do better and i&amp;#39;m glad i made that call because uh they certainly did better here this record is uh what holy [ __ ] this is better than cavalcade from front to back this lp is so thrilling and intense stunningly beautiful the vibe of the whole thing encapsulated perfectly on the intro track with geordie greep&amp;#39;s intense rants spilling out against marching snares dashing string sections as well as dissonant shots of strings and pianos that just jut just punch again and again and again this track sounds like the introduction to what is going to be either the worst or maybe the best experience of my life from here we get a fitting transition into the song sugar tsu with an announcer calling out as if we are about to uh witness a boxing match of some sort which makes sense instrumentally anyway because this song is pummeling as a bit of a jazz rock nerd i&amp;#39;ll say this i feel like this track alone can go toe-to-toe with some of the best some of the classics some of the most intense and brutal jazz rock out there be it uh you know some freaking soft machine or zappa or zorn or maha vishnu first off like what are these runs what are these arpeggios humans are playing this human human beings like with their hands and stuff oh my god i mean the sports theme of the track is fitting given that it&amp;#39;s like a physical feat not just to play this but to listen through it and uh really pay attention to each detail plus the ascending horn transitions that hit in between these passages following that the loose and dramatic instrumental passages over which grief describes this a surreal and very strange violent boxing match whole thing sounds like it was made up in a fever dream and from section to section of the story it really moves like a roller coaster the song eat men eat instrumentally is almost as brutal with unsettling blends of prague rock and jazz but this one goes in a slightly more acoustic direction the contrast between the relaxed verses and vicious choruses is devastating there are a few other changes to note too like the vocals now being taken on by uh cameron picton who doesn&amp;#39;t come across vocally as bold or as in command of whatever pitch he&amp;#39;s trying to hit a lot of the time that being said though the more manic and screamed vocal passages on this cut are just as intense as any on this lp so vocally speaking it&amp;#39;s not like this track is a total dud and the other thing i&amp;#39;d like to dive into at least a little bit with this track is the storytelling which seems to be about a trippy or life-threatening reaction to a bunch of food a captain fed to his crew like the boxing match there is sort of an old world familiarity to the backdrop and to the setting of this story but it&amp;#39;s retold in the most profoundly disturbing way possible so i do enjoy elements of this track as well but i will say i&amp;#39;m a bit more enamored with these straight-up rock grooves and raw riffs of welcome to hell which i think is more of an homage to primus than i&amp;#39;ve heard almost any band do over the past several years some elements of the song sound like they&amp;#39;re straight off of frizzle fry sans the slap bass of course but we do get those tight drums those sour chords the barked lyrics many of which touch down on the violent and insane nature of a military mentality but that special black midi touch comes by way of the performance growing more and more chaotic as it progresses and some of the mountainous hits of horns and strings that come at certain points of the song the song still is a quaint cool down moment on the lp goes in more of a folk and western direction with some very lovely finger picking what sounds like dreamy pedal steel cameron is back on vocal duty but i think his more measured demeanor fits a lot better with the acoustics on this one he even manages to nail those ascending vocal harmonies around the midpoint to the track too from here the whole track transitions into this sleepy bed of storybook instrumentation birds chirping strings drowning it is pretty and it does effectively transition into the interlude point at the middle of the lp half time which is a a bit of a radio themed comedy relief piece so yes all that great all that good but i do think this portion of the song does drag on just just a touch but from here we move into a very strong second half for this lp the race is about to begin as handily the most insane song on this whole record at least in terms of the intensity of it anyway greep is on vocals again and he&amp;#39;s leading what essentially sounds like jarring circus prague the vocals are mixed so goddamn loud and they are moving at the speed of a coked-up auctioneer with all these crashing riffs and drums and pianos just creating such a cacophony in the background there&amp;#39;s even a theatrical little passage in the first third that sounds like something out of a vaudeville show the track is just pure sensory overload which makes the really dramatic and spotlit vocal passages on the back end of the song even more gratifying really a calm after the storm or oh it feels like finally going to sleep after a super rough night that went into the wee hours of the morning the fire on this lp continues on to dangerous liaisons which instrumentally may not be as dizzying as race but there is a really strong and interesting narrative coming off of this one it&amp;#39;s a story of a farm hand who is paid to murder a man strangle him to death i&amp;#39;ll leave the spoilers for the track there but still what a dark and strange moment on this project and also just a testament to greek storytelling abilities as at least i found myself hanging on every single word the defense is a refreshing change of pace as i think this one is the most ballad-like cut on the entire lp very straightforward as well in terms of its chord progression and its structure instrumentally this is a pretty grand moment on the lp as well with greep&amp;#39;s vocals kind of locking in with these massive string sections soaring off into the sky like he&amp;#39;s some kind of a bizarro lounge singer three minutes though for a moment that is this sweet on an album that is this harrowing does seem a tad bit scant though i think the finale of this one could have been pushed a little bit further even if it does come to a pretty tight close and the song 27 questions ends things off strong with another helping of the same harrowing bitter avant prague that has painted much of the tracklist so far topped with more surreal extravagant and also cd imagery in the lyrics with what i think are at least a few narrative callbacks to tracks prior on the lp i wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if all or many of the songs here tie together uh conceptually in some way but either way there&amp;#39;s a pivotal moment on this track where the protagonist breaks into song in the song in a very lovely and quaint way it&amp;#39;s not quite 27 questions which is uh pointed out in the lyrics but i love how we move into this kind of sweet passage here uh that uh is is asking all of these like you know absurd inquiries and from here we move into some of the most hideous passages of aggressive and pounding instrumentation on the entire record to finish things off like really honestly the finish of this lp is just not [ __ ] the [ __ ] around and damn like what a great and hard-hitting creative bold colorful uh dizzying and overwhelming series of tracks from black midi uh even better than the batch of songs again in my opinion than they offered on cavalcade like not only better in terms of instrumental ambitions songwriting lyrics but i think some of the influences they were really wearing on their sleeves on the last lp they&amp;#39;ve really kind of morphed into their own thing they&amp;#39;ve kind of like sucked those in and kind of turned them into something that feels more unique to them are there a few passages and tracks and ideas that i think pale in comparison to others and a little brief or maybe drag on yes but outside of that like nearly every section of this record is mind-blowing amazing boundary pushing and black midi should absolutely be proud of everything they&amp;#39;ve done on this record because i think like not only are they doing experimental rock and progressive rock and every other thing they&amp;#39;re referencing here like a huge service uh with an album this good but uh you know they&amp;#39;re really like punching with the same force as the greats on this one as well and i think that&amp;#39;s only going to become more apparent as we have more and more time to digest this record i&amp;#39;m feeling a decent two strong nine on this one tran position have you given this record a listen did you love it did you hate it but would you rate it you&amp;#39;re

lp of sweden&amp;#39;s own viagra boys within a matter of several years these guys have become one of the best and most enjoyable most fantastic most fun and interesting post punk bands on the scene but they did not gain their success at least in my opinion by being merely an exercise in nostalgia just merely holding to the genres more traditional forms as their grime cake productions sleazy lyrics and absurd sense of humor not only are pretty refreshing for this style but feel very specific to them and it&amp;#39;s great to hear on this new lp not only is all of that stuff carrying over into this new batch of songs but on this thing we&amp;#39;re also getting an expanded instrumental palette as well as some pretty conceptual lyrical themes with a lot of songs in the track list here focusing on the dysfunction of the human condition which of course is presented in the frame of the modern day with all of the paranoia and hatred and conspiracy theories that are spread across social media these days but that&amp;#39;s also juxtaposed against this image of humanity as apes rudimentary life forms that were destined for the tragedy that we&amp;#39;re currently in due to our origins which plays out on tracks like the cognitive tradeoff hypothesis which sees front man sebastian murphy ghoulishly theorizing about how we were kicked out of the trees like in the early days left to fend for ourselves and had to essentially develop other traits in order to survive there&amp;#39;s even a point where he questions whether or not this change in evolution and cognition has anything to do with his uh suffering from add and with all the colorful tones cartoony vocals along with the super deep and murky drums and bass on this track which are incredibly groovy the song couldn&amp;#39;t sound more like the weirdest gorillas recording that you&amp;#39;ve ever heard some of these themes i was mentioning also turn up on the opener baby criminal which presents an idea that i think has gotten a lot of exploration as of late especially with the recent jump in mass shootings committed by very young men and yeah the song essentially asks how do you go from an innocent little baby to a a violent bloodthirsty young adult or adult this question is set to wailing saxophones driving dance beats and guitars that don&amp;#39;t know whether or not they&amp;#39;re trying to soundtrack a dance floor a noise rock concert at a small venue or like a surf guitar competition still it sounds awesome all the same there&amp;#39;s also troglodyte which features one of my favorite instrumentals here with a driving beat and lots of quirky colorful bits of guitar and synthesizer this track sounds like it&amp;#39;s cut from the devo playbook in the best way possible but this is also a very tense and kind of angry track about going crazy and violent but the contextual nods and the lyrics are a bit more specific and current talking about a guy who&amp;#39;s sitting on his computer and writing about things that he hates thinking all the news is fake and how if these people were alive during the time of apes they would have been shunned out of you know the apes society is unevolved there&amp;#39;s even a point on this record where sebastian murphy is embodying the mindset of one of these individuals specifically on the track creepy crawlers which is not so much a song as much as it is a rant about 5g and lizard people and adrenochrome and vaccines all set to a spiral of never-ending noisy rock instrumentation and yeah while it&amp;#39;s not exactly catchy it is more intense and hilarious frankly than many of the other cuts here many of the ideas i&amp;#39;ve been talking about so far come to a head on the closing track return to monkey which kicks off with this leave society be a monkey tagline and essentially advocates for a lot of these hateful and uh kind of out of control people to essentially uh separate themselves from society and go live in the jungle instead hey you hate getting vaccinated uh nobody nobody needs to get vaccinated in the jungle where sebastian says they spend their time throwing [ __ ] at each other hanging out and masturbating the blistering noise rock passages to continue past this point are of course exhilarating and stellar and i absolutely love the measured spoken word outro for the song and the record as a whole which makes the album and everything it&amp;#39;s about feel like a social experiment of some sort that has now gone awry and it&amp;#39;s getting shut down reset cleaned off all for things to play out maybe the same way again which again is kind of an interesting and somewhat twilight zone-esque note to end on now outside of this there are some other deep cuts and singles on the record that i think are quite good be it ain&amp;#39;t no thief which is a track that&amp;#39;s all about aggressively thrusting off these allegations of having stolen something even though the items in question and the scenarios they were acquired in are so oddly specific they had to have been stolen this track also features one of my favorite instrumentals on the lp it kind of sounds like uh something out of a chase scene from a 1970s cop movie well wicka wow look at what we&amp;#39;re like the dirtiest post-punkiest funk ever there&amp;#39;s also punk rock loser who&amp;#39;s very slow pacing when i first heard it didn&amp;#39;t exactly win me over but the loose messy grooves and deadpan swagger have worked their charms on me as i&amp;#39;ve revisited the song again and again and lyrically the track is really just a perfect mix of charisma and also self-deprecation and i like that these two elements are blended so finely and so aggressively you really can&amp;#39;t tell like where the track lands on that spectrum the whole thing is so half-hearted in its performance it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s trying to unachieve but the fact that it doesn&amp;#39;t give a [ __ ] is what makes it so attractive there&amp;#39;s also big boy which is a very odd and kind of lo-fi moment on the album with some acoustic guitars in the background a a bunch of looping cycling drum beats some tongue-in-cheek falsetto harmonies on the chorus too the whole track sounds like a freaky hip-hop 90s singer-songwriter jam which i think is the best kind of detour for this album at this point uh even with it being a bit of a love song in a way if you could kind of interpret it to be so with it uh having his twisted presentation as it does there&amp;#39;s also jason williamson of sleepered mods fame on the back end of the track doing one of his trademark rants which i think is a perfect addition to the song and then we have add which i think is the most electronic sounding track on the record with its persistent drum and synth sequences a lot of the track is about the inability to focus the cute and simple dance groove along with the sort of sloppy keys make it sound like it&amp;#39;s trying to be a tongue-in-cheek club hit the more electronic aesthetics also fit with lines like i hope they replace my brain with a computer and flow-wise the track serves as a nice calm before the storm of the fiery closer i&amp;#39;m not really sure what to say about this album past this point other than i am really impressed with it on multiple levels be it the production the instrumentation the overall performances specifically the vocal performances the writing and concepts spread across the record too how tight and fantastically flowing the track list is it&amp;#39;s really all killer no filler and even the interludes on the project are effectively applicated this is handily the best project yet in my opinion from viagra boys it&amp;#39;s maybe my favorite rock record so far this year and it&amp;#39;s really everything i&amp;#39;ve loved about the band up until this point turned up to [ __ ] 11. sure there are some tracks here that don&amp;#39;t play as effectively into the more conceptual notes of the album as well as other tracks do and there are some parts that i think come off a little samey in terms of the drum grooves or maybe even the vocals like i think the record in in some ways could be a tad bit more versatile but honestly that&amp;#39;s the extent of my complaints with this record it kicks ass i love it i think it&amp;#39;s fantastic i&amp;#39;m mega mega mega impressed with it and i&amp;#39;m going to be sitting on this one and digesting it for a while i&amp;#39;m feeling a strong nine on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love

full-length album from london-based rock outfit petrol girls first time hearing their stuff here and honestly uh pretty quickly listening to this i was blown away as this is truly a record for our current times in terms of tone messaging and righteous anger such a heavy forward-thinking and versatile sound for a punk album too as stylistically this record very much has a foot in the old and the new of course with this being a punk album from the uk petrol girls are very easily able to tap into that snide crass snotty tone that some of the best bands from that country have but by that same token the band seems equally as indebted to the american riot girl movement in terms of their mid-paced rifts sass and feminist rage occasionally the angular rips and leads on this thing read like something from a 2000s era post hardcore lp2 and on top of that the production on this thing is sick these tracks are laced with gargantuan and very rough guitar tones very intense vocal performances too that range from melodic like with the urgent and soaring vocal harmonies on the track fight for our lives or the explosive closing moments of feed my fire so there is versatility there but also this isn&amp;#39;t a super long record either nothing really overstays its welcome with this thing clocking in at 34 minutes this lp is essentially trying to hit you with a bold and thoughtful message in as fast a time as possible and pounds it in hard with drums and guitars that are pushed to the limit just to make sure that you get it now sometimes it&amp;#39;s also just the width displayed on these tracks that catches me like with the opening bars on the song preachers there&amp;#39;s a lot of preachers but i don&amp;#39;t see no saints a lot of fingers pointing palms sweating under red paint you know the idea of being caught red-handed but also being the accuser but yeah essentially an excellent reflection on public condemnation damnation and lack of nuance as a theme is also explored on the track one or the other presenting these rigid dichotomies as if someone must either be a victim or an abuser a man or a woman themes of division also play out on the song clowns too and i think there&amp;#39;s a lot that can be gleaned out of the cutting lyrics and devastating snark on this track about existing in an ignorantly blissful dream of good intentions and adopting centrism as a political safe space out of a need to not be controversial or not be uh rubbing people the wrong way going against the grain meanwhile in our authoritarian times as this record says that&amp;#39;s just allowing the bastards to run the place now if you&amp;#39;re looking for an even bolder statement on this lp you have the track baby i had an abortion between the droning distorted tones on this track and the heavy ass drums this thing hits as hard as something like out of swann&amp;#39;s early discography or maybe an idol&amp;#39;s album with calls of whose life are you pro who&amp;#39;s do you want to control meanwhile the gang vocals on the hook of baby i had an abortion and these snarling guitar leads are fantastic that proclamation being made in a mocking tone and in such a way to where it&amp;#39;s sure to anger any pro-lifer which i think is necessary given that the verses illustrating the absurdity of their position will go over their heads then the song unsettled is a really interesting reflection on love and relationships rather than settling we are unsettling topically exploring modern romance as if it is a mold or a category to fall into with restrictions with lyrics mentioning wanting to be held but not held back it&amp;#39;s a powerful statement on the ways in which love can be restricting even paralyzing if not engaged in in a way that is equitable and healthy though there also seems to be this nagging fear of of commitment and things kind of breaking off and failing at some point and wanting to finish things prematurely in order to avoid that the next two tracks on this lp feature vocals from janie starling a feminist organizer and former vocalist of the band dream nails the first of these two tracks fight for our lives features these heavy just crushing industrial guitar tones and drums which i think is very fitting for the song because it sounds like a goddamn war definitely a response to current times and the ongoing systematic violence against trans people sex workers undocumented women violent by design is your classic punk cops or [ __ ] screed i think it shouldn&amp;#39;t be news to anyone that they are not here to protect you they&amp;#39;re here to protect power as an institution the groovy drums and riffs on this track have almost a 90s alt rock feel to them but done so much harsher and more aggressively i also love the quirky girly vocal breakdowns that pop in here and they&amp;#39;re there to make us safe keep us in our place criminals must pay so do what they say and yeah i&amp;#39;m loving the bounce back and forth between the poetic sarcasm and also the enraged lead vocals that are just making salient points and asking the right questions sick and tired is essentially an all-of-the-above run-down of everything weighing down on the band from health issues to backaches to no breaks having to constantly protest against injustice and violence against women dealing with fake allies that don&amp;#39;t actually have their best interests at heart keep in mind as i&amp;#39;m running through these tracks and the various topics they dive into drums riffs vocals performances writing across the board is all killer kick-ass detailed heavy colorful textured truly more going into this punk record than most and with the closer bones we have a more epic finish than you would expect from most punk lps with grand group chorus harmonies calling out take away the noise and i am bones built the rhythms of my life on all this which reminds me of the sometimes cinematic grandiosity that you might get off of a [ __ ] up album when they were at their creative and conceptual peak back in the day though i&amp;#39;ve never been much for [ __ ] up however i do enjoy this quite a bit but yeah overall i thought this was a kick ass and necessary album some of the most fiery punk i&amp;#39;ve heard in a while and damn i just reviewed this freaking soul glow record too the most major issue i had on any single track here was probably on feed my fire where the transition into the more melodic vocal passages is a bit awkward not only that but the melody itself is odd and kind of slippery and i&amp;#39;m not really sure if even the band itself has that tight of a grip of it but the intensely performed guitars and drums still are a treat especially toward the finish but yeah i love this thing i love the hell out of this thing uh once again found it super impressive on first listen and as i dove into it further and further and further it just kind of kicked more ass and said more very pertinent things and i hope you guys can take away as much from it as i currently am i&amp;#39;m feeling a light too decent nine on this one tran position have you given this record a listen did you love it did you hate it but would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please

    "transcript": "hi everyone realty punk tano here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new soul glow album diaspora problems this is the fourth full-length lp from east coast punk outfit soul glow their first for epitaph records and comes after a series of hardcore leaning eps that introduced me to the band&amp;#39;s music over the past couple of years causing me to go into their back catalog which honestly has very much been a treat it was just one of those moments where i was like [ __ ] what have i been missing out on because i most definitely would have heaped praise onto their last full-length lp had i heard it because even in the raw state that their earlier releases are my god this is just some punishing hardcore the performances are so completely out of control unhinged and in a way reminds me of what the genre was at its peak in the 80s the aggression feels less calculated the intensity of the sound less indebted to how loud the production is and is more due to how wild the playing is which again reads like many early classic discord record releases as well as the early stuff of suicidal tendencies or even bad brains however i have to say diaspora problems is not just some exercise in hardcore nostalgia because punk is often a genre that can be obsessed with its past to a fault which can lead to stuff like gatekeeping as well as favoring sonically a tradition over progression but that is very much not a problem on this record in fact the way soul glow combines elements of hardcore indie noise and screamo is pretty refreshing plus they&amp;#39;re not exactly shy about suddenly breaking into a song that has more hip-hop leanings too i should also praise the songs on this record too because the songs are good take the opening track here for example which i know listening to it it&amp;#39;s very easy to get whipped up in the speed and intensity of the whole thing but it actually takes a lot of thought about structuring and dynamics to write a song like this that is this long and firing on all cylinders almost the entire time and it doesn&amp;#39;t get boring it doesn&amp;#39;t get drab it&amp;#39;s just like edge of your seat from start to finish from the bright and sort of jangly guitar chords that open the intro to the chugging breakdowns toward the end underneath refrains of who got me my ass who could be fast and i wouldn&amp;#39;t gloss over the lyrics either they are an absolute shotgun blast of reflections on materialism violence insecurity societal pressures to give into normalized [ __ ] like some of the best hardcore bands of all time i think you&amp;#39;ll find that soul glove has a lot to say a whole lot to say sometimes to the point where you know the the rhythm and meter of the vocals is kind of just thrown to the wayside because uh what&amp;#39;s more important is just getting out this lyrical machine gun fire so next from here we have the song coming correct is cheaper which th they did not sample the think break on this song you know that popular sample that&amp;#39;s made it in many a dance and hip hop song over the years it&amp;#39;s been used so many times from it takes two to even the latest porter robinson record and now it is here on this completely enraged hardcore punk diatribe about constantly feeling judged and appraised and limited by the expectations of modern society there&amp;#39;s even a point where the lyrics here become a devastating statement on like a generational dead end in terms of having hopes for the aspirations that your kids will have or the things that they&amp;#39;ll achieve beyond you plus that line about eating the rich and tradition and habits coming connected to fine print that are that are being handed down to you like the social commentary on this record is thumb sucker continues to see the band throwing left hooks into the track list with some really rocking hardcore riffs and peppy horn sections that actually pair together really well [ __ ] up if true hits with some riffs that dabble in a little bit of crossover thrash topped with enraged lyrics about our broken political system that does not serve the majority of voters oh and the noisy death metal breakdown on the back end is really cool jump or get jumped i loved as a single it sounds just as sick in the tracklist too i would say the band is absolutely nailing this balance between these thoughtful songs that obviously have a lot of care and planning put into them but they deliver them in such a way that feels manic out of control and overwhelming dripanomics was another teaser to the record that was a little off-putting at first but the more i hear it the more it grows on me it&amp;#39;s like this noise rap punk fusion that features a lot of bars a lot of flows that sound like asap ferg rapping off of a helium tank over a grimy trap beat laced with all of these like power electronics and feedback samples and the whole track is about selling and upselling height beast clothes and like you know designer stuff yeezy birkin nike all these name brands the mother mary rose feature is a perfect fit and overall it&amp;#39;s just a very clever and novel funny topic idea for a song five years in my family tells a story of one&amp;#39;s personal progression to punk and the way tragedy and difficult family dynamics can make it hard to come to certain realizations about yourself and your mental health like again when i say this album does a lot and is speaking to a lot it really is the grinding riffs and blast beats on the things i carry makes for another blistering moment even more searing are the lyrics which are packed with all this radical self-accountability describing a lot of personal toxic behavioral patterns over sinister guitar leads some spoken word passages from the featured artist on the track bearcat 2. all of which come together and make for a very visceral but dark combination we want&amp;#39;s revenge is probably the most cut and dry track on the entire lp it doesn&amp;#39;t get more explicit than blaring riffs and screamo vocals that are doubled up and so hard hitting it gives blood brothers old stuff a run for its money i wouldn&amp;#39;t say there&amp;#39;s a whole lot of gray area in the lyrics too the final moments of this record refuse to sink into something that&amp;#39;s run of the mill john jay&amp;#39;s relentless drums and frightening noise core riffs are great even if at points the lyrics may be a bit much in terms of just scrambling to get it all out still the breakdown and demonic chorus vocals around the midpoint and the build and feature the song delivers from there is great god bless you all real good hits with a bit of a narrative switch as uh topically i would say this song is diving pretty deep into some very personal and very petty drama i mean it&amp;#39;s not as if hardcore doesn&amp;#39;t have a tradition of embracing narratives of betrayal it definitely does but man this very long-winded story about friends or or rather ex-friends it goes it&amp;#39;s explosive it hits hard but i also feel like i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;m kind of reading an endless like twitter thread of just like people who know each other going at each other&amp;#39;s thrones we then from here have the closer a spiritual level of gang [ __ ] where soul glow kind of takes the whole lp out on a sort of mellow hip-hop vibe with really spacey instrumentation some pretty solid features from mckinley dixon as well as logee for the first half i would say this track is a little average instrumentally though outside of the pummeling hardcore riffs popping in here and there to transition us from one section to the next am i blown away by it no but i will say it&amp;#39;s still better than the vast majority of punk rap fusions i&amp;#39;ve heard over the course of my lifetime and i lived through the 2000s plus the whole thing comes to a massive finish with really heavy horn sections and a refrain that brings a sense of togetherness which i think is a nice change of pace from all of the uh you know division intention going on in many of the narratives across the record up to this point [ __ ] what a good ass [ __ ] punk record my god like again performances writing riffs messaging production songwriting everything is just on [ __ ] point the versatility and creativity too the fact that this band stared right in the face the difficulty the challenge of modernizing and updating in in a great way like one of the most tried and true like stylistically black and white genres of underground music and just thwarted that just completely overcame that problem with no hesitation whatsoever even though there are spots of the record that i think are just a little over the top just doing a bit too much combined with the fact that the track list does fall apart a bit in terms of cohesion toward the end still with all of that like man this thing is mind-blowing it&amp;#39;s great it&amp;#39;s amazing it&amp;#39;s fantastic this was easily one of my most anticipated albums of the year and it met my expectations and went far beyond them as well really blew them out of the water for the most part i&amp;#39;m feeling a decent two strong nine on this one tran position have you given this record a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please

    "transcript": "hi everyone drama channel here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new conway the machine record god don&amp;#39;t make mistakes this is a brand new lp from rapper and buffalo native conway the machine an important notch in his growing artistic belt his debut album for eminem&amp;#39;s shady records considering that and the fact this record has been pushed back a little bit there&amp;#39;s been a lot of anticipation for it with many fans including me assuming conway would go all out for this one and he did but not in the obvious way that a lot of artists may for a record like this like of course there are some big names on this lp like lil wayne rick ross ti there&amp;#39;s production in the mix from a lot of griselda mainstays but also hit boy as well as the alchemist and justice league but the most striking thing about god don&amp;#39;t make mistakes is how revealing it is some of the most memorable moments from conway&amp;#39;s last high-water mark from king to a god were the most introspective and the machine digs in even deeper on this lp plus some of the best crossovers on this thing are either the most familiar or the most unlikely of course there&amp;#39;s john wu flick with benny the butcher and west side gun where they just continue to bring that next level grimy chemistry and nail that down in only the way these three guys can there&amp;#39;s also drum work which of course is named after conway&amp;#39;s label and features more familiar faces j skis and love the genius and they bring two of the best features they&amp;#39;ve done with conway so far now the extraordinary talent that is jill scott is featured on this record too not just with a song but a wrapped feature which plays the other side of a love connection being portrayed on chanel pearls and it&amp;#39;s easily one of the best here like the flow is great the lyrical detail is there it locks into the greater narrative of the song perfectly and when jill breaks into those melodic lines on the back end of her appearance it&amp;#39;s like not only amazing but it&amp;#39;s two features in one keisha plum&amp;#39;s intro on the song babis is surreal and sexual mesmerizing and conway&amp;#39;s mother&amp;#39;s vocals are featured on the final track of the record in in a way i won&amp;#39;t completely uh spoil here but they are legitimately heart-wrenching and contribute to a very strong finish on this lp which thematically ties back to a lot of bars and ideas throughout the rest of the record which makes me have to point out that god don&amp;#39;t make mistakes is conway&amp;#39;s most holistic project yet in terms of consistency and vision the intro cut lock load creeps in with one of the most murderous instrumentals on the entire lp the droning synth chords the somewhat mushy rhythm guitars the first vocals on the track are conway commenting on how spooky the vibe is on this one and i have to agree 100 there&amp;#39;s a smoky tone to his voice on this one like he&amp;#39;s trying to keep uh what he&amp;#39;s rapping about a secret which of course only enhances his entrancing flow his deadly bars sound like an endless nightmare and end where a very complimentary beanie siegel feature begins now beanie&amp;#39;s inclusion on this track and this record is actually genius and reinforces the greater themes of this lp in a lot of ways because beanie and conway are each victims of gun violence and in both instances it impacted their careers and performance in significant ways that and the violent horrors being lyrically portrayed on this track make it almost a mirror of the closer that sees conway kind of quietly contemplating what if what if he had made different choices on that day that he was shot decided to be in a different place with a different person how would things have panned out would he be where he is today later in the track list we have piano love which is pure conway in pretty much every single way from the creepy fragmented pianos the fat beats just unadulterated lyrical nastiness hollow tips having your girl sneak a gun in for you in her large bag crack bars that are so detailed they&amp;#39;re almost freaking confessional he said it&amp;#39;s spooky things begin to mellow out in the tracklist on the song wild chapters which sees conway reflecting on the traumatic events and egregious behavior that he needed to transcend to get to where he is today he flows so effortlessly over this track as well in terms of like narrative and wording it sounds less like he&amp;#39;s rapping less like a verse and more like a spoken monologue t.i and novel also do a great job on the track of reinforcing the songs themes of personal growth and perseverance a great hit boy beat on this one too that features these uh little cycling melodies quietly playing in the background like a tune that you would hum to yourself there&amp;#39;s a beautiful nostalgia to this track that hits really deep as well which i would say is is also the case uh for the following guilty that has all these gorgeous keys and uh pitched soul chops in the beat many of the bars on this one read like a frank meditation on the ways having gotten shot has infected impacted conway from the bell&amp;#39;s palsy to numbness in his legs and sort of seeing the comments and reactions that that has gotten online and what more can you say it&amp;#39;s like great rapping it&amp;#39;s great performance it&amp;#39;s great writing and conway is delivering with the confidence and the clarity of like jay-z and his prime in the mid-2000s they&amp;#39;re stressed which is obviously about stress this is conway&amp;#39;s biggest emotional vent on any song ever kind of starts off typical in a way for a rap song working this angle he&amp;#39;s stressed due to the pressure on him all the attention uh people who are not really taking his emotions seriously and asking for handouts left and right but then very quickly from here we move deeper into conway coping with a depression addiction the death of his son the suicide of his cousin it&amp;#39;s absolutely positively in every way that it can be just devastating if you don&amp;#39;t feel for this guy after this track i don&amp;#39;t know what to tell you like man the final moments on this lp aren&amp;#39;t all doom and gloom though and in some ways conway&amp;#39;s push to be understood as a multi-dimensional person on the song so much more is even more moving as he demands to not just be pigeonholed as a rapper or even just a stereotype of a rapper cause on this track he raps about his humanity his charity his heart his perspective which is obviously at this point in his career really admirable the ways in which he&amp;#39;s been able to geniusly navigate the music industry to grow his profile but also maintain an incredible amount of artistic freedom from here the luxurious and romantic chanel pearls is a great change of pace once more that jill scott features fire and again the closing track brings things full circle on this lp in such a powerful way now in my opinion there are a few weak points in the track list but i think they&amp;#39;re pretty relative these cuts do have some decent moments despite some flaws namely tear gas with lil wayne and rick ross i think this track features a pretty good showing lyrically from everybody involved but everyone&amp;#39;s respective energy just is so separate and compartmentalized there isn&amp;#39;t really a super strong chorus bringing it all together either i think the rick ross verse on the back end feels almost tacked on after such an insane verse from wayne again good production good performances but the structure isn&amp;#39;t the best and i think it kind of sticks out like a sore thumb given just how cohesive narratively and conceptually pretty much every other song here is especially with the other features that are in play then i think the song babas is a bit of a tough sell as well again while i love that keisha plum intro it&amp;#39;s after that things begin to trail off with conway i think trying to write and deliver in a similarly fragmented and abstract style with a bit of a demonic chorus effect underneath his voice very subtly and i just don&amp;#39;t know if like this direction is the best for him it comes off a little awkward doesn&amp;#39;t really reach a strong conclusion either even though i do love the fact that this beat is the most nightmarish and strangest on the entire lp it&amp;#39;s definitely a unique moment you know you can&amp;#39;t say it&amp;#39;s a just kind of a generic spot or just a track that blends in with everything else and in terms of the greater album flow it does provide an interestingly dark pocket just before this kind of self-affirming finish but that&amp;#39;s kind of it for my complaints honestly like the vast vast majority of the material on this lp is the best conway&amp;#39;s ever done he has outdone himself again his artistry and vision just continues to grow and i love it i&amp;#39;m feeling a strong a to a light 9 on this one tran position have you given this record a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should i review next hit like if you like please subscribe

believe in you what&amp;#39;s it called dragon new warm mountain i believe in you a dragon a dragon what dragon new worm out and i believe in you you believe in the what dragon new warm mountain i believe in you a new magnet dragon dragon new war mountain i believe in you a heehee ha-ha dragon what a woodso dragon new warm mountain i believe in you it&amp;#39;s a brand new album from indie folk and indie rock outfit big thief their fifth to date if i remember correctly and it&amp;#39;s been a minute since we&amp;#39;ve heard from the band like many groups on the indie circuit during the pandemic big thief pretty much laid low during much of that time who could blame them without the ability to tour on top of that they kind of spoiled fans in 2019 with two records released in that year the second of which left a far more positive impression on me than the first front woman adrian lanker also dropped two sister solo albums in the year 2020 that were pretty great james and buck members of the band also kept pretty busy with their own solo material too but now they&amp;#39;re back in big thief mode obviously and it seems they wanted to make a big return with 20 whole new tracks on this record which i was kind of hesitant going into because i i do like big thief but do i 80 minutes like big thief plus albums of this size tend to be super thematic and conceptual and there&amp;#39;s a whole series of risk factors that come into play with that but in a way i was refreshed to find that dragon new warm mountain is a double album that feels almost half its length the record&amp;#39;s actually kind of fun and maybe even a little easy to listen to as end to end it&amp;#39;s packed with all these punchy and direct blends of indie folk folk rock art country with a few semi-psychedelic experiments in the mix too in many ways i think this lp takes off from where big thief left us on their two hands record but kind of dives into that direction as boldly as they possibly can this lp also strikes a really good balance between consistency and variety featuring some of big thief&amp;#39;s best songs to date too like spud infinity red moon and blue lightning all of which are really wild backwater country and folk with lots of colorful backing instrumentation linkers vocals provide a smart and kind of eccentric twang to the whole thing meanwhile songs like simulation swarm the only place in certainty feel a lot more modern pulling from some classic indie folk acts such as elliott smith modest mouse bonnie prince billy especially in the rhythm section and guitar work not to mention 12 000 lines is just about the best joni mitchell warship i&amp;#39;ve heard in a minute for simplicity&amp;#39;s sake we also have some very stripped back acoustic cuts that could have fit on linker&amp;#39;s last couple of solo records dried roses promises a pendulum of course on these tracks linker&amp;#39;s vocals and unique lyricism shine like the communication and emotional blocks on promise being likened to hearing fantastically quiet things or impossibly building these natural wonders such as rainbows or a meteor shower these pockets of the record contrast nicely of course with moments where they&amp;#39;re diving into some really rich sonic experimentation like time escaping for example the quirky arpeggios and lo-fi beet loops on this one create a total groove gasm which gives way to these heavenly rushes of vocal harmonies and flower of blood is a pretty effective combination of indie folk aesthetics and hazy 90s shoe gaze in my opinion meanwhile the subtle and dusty lo-fi drums and eerie ringing keys and guitars on blurred view really crawl into your brain stem along with adrian&amp;#39;s vocals being so close they&amp;#39;re almost asmr and i have to mention wake me up to drive the peppy casio drum machine beats on this one along with the accordion sound like the result of some kind of random instrument generator but big thief somehow makes it work sounding like one of the coolest and weirdest open mic performances i&amp;#39;ve ever heard and also let&amp;#39;s not forget extra instrumental touches on the lp here and there such as the woodwinds on no reason so good lankers performances and songwriting and lyricism as well that i have to mention are such an anchor throughout this lp of course her talents have already been proven her character has already been proven on previous big thief records especially her solo stuff but on this lp especially i would say they are elevated with all the backing instrumentation to a height that they&amp;#39;ve never been at before whether you&amp;#39;re talking about some writing from her that is just unbearably cute and heartwarming like i want to be the shoelace that you tie on blue lightning the poetic portrayals of unity and oneness at the atomic level on the song the only place the heart wrenching calls for love on love love love simulation swarm features one of the quickest and stickiest vocal melodies i think lankers ever pinned plus the way it unfolds into these longer melodic strands around the chorus and features this a warm rush of instrumentation pictured along with imagery of embracing it&amp;#39;s beautiful plus going into each of these tracks i never really know what the the point of inspiration or what the uh personal or contextual reference point is going to be so it kind of makes each track an adventure now of course with 20 songs on this project there are going to be a couple cuts that i or you find a little underwhelming for me personally it&amp;#39;s spots like the opener which in my opinion is uncharacteristically bland instrumentally and even lyrically to a degree given the quality of all the other tracks on the record even though i think big thief wanted to let fans and listeners in easy on the track in a way i kind of prefer that they would have just let it rip from the jump the track little things offers a lot of noise a lot of chaos a lot of colorful hazy layers instrumentally but a strong melody and song i don&amp;#39;t think really shines through all the clutter and there are a lot of things i like about the wintry title track on this lp uh there are some spots where vocally lenker reminds me a bit of a stevie nicks even joanna newsom to a degree but as much as i enjoy the vibe and the aesthetic the progression doesn&amp;#39;t really do all that much for me especially toward the end which i think the song offers maybe the most inconclusive finish of any track here but with all that being said with these being like the low points for me uh that&amp;#39;s only like the case relatively the quality gap between these tracks and every other song here is not that great and generally i think the songwriting the production and instrumentation on this project is fantastic again for 20 freaking tracks i really get the sense that i&amp;#39;m sitting here in the middle of a weird campfire folk jam situation like is a portrayed on the cover i just love it i think big thief showed a lot of muscle a lot of character a lot of emotional potency and just a lot of creativity on this project i think this record very clearly makes them one of the best that indie folk has to offer currently and everything about this record is so great you don&amp;#39;t really have to dig that deep into it to understand what makes it so fun and beautiful and and really relaxing i think to listen to like everything that&amp;#39;s great about this lp is just so on the surface in a way uh you know i love this kind of record because it just kind of makes my job a little easier because you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not like uh the the beauty and the magic of this lp is like obscured by some kind of weird concept or uh some you know difficult to digest sound that needs to be like expounded upon or anything like that it&amp;#39;s just like a really heartwarming uh emotional rollercoaster of a little folk record that just has so much good material packed into it it offers so much good stuff and you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a bit of a casual vibe too in a way so it&amp;#39;s not even like you need to like pressure yourself into hearing the whole [ __ ] thing in one sitting you know each of these tracks i think can be uh pulled out and enjoyed on their own or they could be listened to as a whole and still there be a lot of merit to uh everything the tracklist is offering in a larger macro picture uh it&amp;#39;s just a great album it&amp;#39;s just a great freaking album with a lot of good freaking songs on it uh feeling a strong eight to a light nine on this one tran position have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it

    "transcript": "uh hi everyone anthony fantano style here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this black country new road record ants from up there this is a new lp from uk rock outfit black country new road quickly following up their beloved debut from last year for the first time which was met with a very warm reception far surpassing the high expectations that fans had of it based on early singles like sunglasses and science fair for the first time may have not been a perfect record but it was so good overnight black country new road pretty much went from a band to watch to one of the best and most exciting the underground had to offer currently with inventive and refreshing combinations of post punk art experimental and post rock not to mention some of the klezmer bits on this record too which were amazing the band also featured the one-of-a-kind vocals and lyricism of isaac wood whose writing and performances were so intensely anxious and detailed that undoubtedly if you came across a black country&amp;#39;s music over the last year so he made an impression on you good or bad now tragically isaac announced his departure from the band just days before this album was set to be released it seems to have been an amicable split with the band saying they plan to continue creatively past this point yes it&amp;#39;s an unfortunate change but at least for now we have this recording this new recording for black country new road uh still in one piece and at the very least on this record they answer the question of whether or not for the first time was merely a fluke beginner&amp;#39;s luck cause once again on this album i&amp;#39;d say the band surpassed expectations hard last year i did an interview with band members lewis evans and tyler hyde and one thing i did glean from it was that they were really excited about the directions that the new music was taking on this record and having heard it now i can see why this thing rests a lot harder on the wide array of instrumentation that the band has access to outside of the baseline of guitars and drums horns pianos synth and violin play a much larger role on this project and not only is this project more versatile instrumentally but it pulls from a larger pool of influences i think too no longer can haters dismiss black country new road simply as a slint rip-off as dumb as that point was to begin with this new lp sports touches of minimalism and prague jazz mixed with the raw emotional chaos of early bright eyes as well as the rock elegance of groups such as talk talk plus the grandiose indie anthemics of wolf parade and arcade fire but just like with for the first time this record isn&amp;#39;t so much about its influences as much as how creatively and uniquely they&amp;#39;re brought together with dynamic performances and passionate writing from end to end pretty much every teaser to this record to one degree or another was fire and the band dropped so many tracks they left very little up to the imagination when the entire thing dropped but still this whole record comes together fantastically the intro on this thing is a tight short instrumental piece in five with bright horns and a loud chaotic finish the track contains a harsh beauty that sets up the theatrical chamber rock of chaos space marine perfectly this song is maybe the closest we&amp;#39;re going to get to an indie rock opera this year the tense beds of pianos and string and guitar are wonderful and really make the vivid imagery in isaac&amp;#39;s lyrics come to life especially during the jubilant chorus so i&amp;#39;m leaving this body and i&amp;#39;m never coming home again i&amp;#39;ll bury the axe here between the window and the kingdom of men jesus the track is so thrilling so edge of your seat so ergasmic even without it following a traditional song structure as instrumentally it just kind of keeps building up tension from here this track and many others on the lp show the band has such a firm grasp of tension and release the song concord after this sees the band tumbling further into forlorn poetic balladry packed with dynamic swells of horns and piano the lyrics here are made up of all of these moving and strange metaphors dealing in longing loss and departure in life and in love i&amp;#39;m just so consistently impressed with isaac&amp;#39;s writing i feel like the beauty of his word speaks for itself i came a gentle hill racer i was breathless upon every mountain just to look for your light but for less than a moment we&amp;#39;d share the same sky and then isaac will suffer concord will fly it&amp;#39;s a bittersweet moment on the record that leads into the incredibly despondent bread song whose instrumental swells like a gigantic orchestral lullaby many of the lyrics on this track seem to describe this unraveling social situation that concludes in this immense moment of rejection oh don&amp;#39;t eat your toast in my bed oh darling i never felt the crumbs until you said this place is not for any man nor particles of bread which is i think a pretty sole uh crushing comparison uh to be made even if it is a little inadvertent the following goodwill hunting is one of those black country new road songs that i know some of the lyrics from it are gonna be stuck in my head repeating in my head for the next year because that was very much the case for multiple songs and lyrical highlights from the last record she had billy eilish style moving to berlin for a little while trying to find something to hold on to the story of the song has this odd mix of awkwardness and hope that i get off of a lot of great and very genuine talking head songs but obviously black country comes to much different instrumental conclusions the story that isaac is telling here is so idyllic and storybook in a way but his wording here makes it clear that what he&amp;#39;s saying is something he&amp;#39;s merely musing about fantasizing about and there&amp;#39;s a sadness to that especially as he launches into this diatribe about how he&amp;#39;d bend over backwards to keep himself in the mind of this other person who he&amp;#39;s singing about traveling through space to get home to them another stellar instrumental performance on the track too even though this song features a more standard song structure the varying beds of instrumentation keep every section of it feeling fresh and new there&amp;#39;s more instrumental magic to follow too on the song haldern i love the repeating minimal horn and piano lines that the song here floats on top of which contrasts nicely with the heavy crunchy guitar riffs in between next mark&amp;#39;s theme is a touching and beautiful little saxon piano piece that effectively works as a palette cleanser before we&amp;#39;re hit with the biggest tracks on the entire record in the last leg now the three cuts this record closes out with pretty much make up half the entire album the place where he inserted the blade which sounds like spencer krug and connor oberst in their prime collaborating on the most grandiose and depressing song they could possibly conceive finishing off as well with these huge group vocals this track in a lot of ways feels like an extension of the cutting and depressive balladry that much of the record has been made up of so far but everything about it is pushed to the brink instrumentally and emotionally meanwhile the song snow globes a nine minute monster kicks off with these very patient plucked down stroked guitar lines with some subtle bass underscoring it sounds kind of like a classic post rock song from the 90s lift your black country like antennas to new road so even if these guitars are instantly recognizable in a somewhat derivative way very quickly we start getting uh these intense flurries of free jazz drumming coloring the whole thing actually coloring might be the wrong word smothering because the drums are so damn loud and mixed so aggressively which even though there are elements of the song i do love uh might make for my least favorite part of this entire record i feel like i&amp;#39;m experiencing the final crescendo of this track from inside one of the toms i do have to give it to the band though because the gradual progression and performance of the entire track is still great then basketball shoes is the multi-phase 12-minute grand finale for the entire record with the sad twangy midwest emo guitar lines coloring the intro the passionate sax lines that build on top of it lyrical themes of decimation and concord return the song somehow becomes even more emo influenced during a riff switch up at the midpoint really everything like from the drums the guitars the lyrics but isaac&amp;#39;s vocals and the extra layers of instrumentation keep this track feeling like it&amp;#39;s firmly in line with everything else on the record consistent the distorted crescendo is ergasmic the uh heavy sax rock outro is amazing the group vocals come back once more one of the best lyrical highlights hits at the very end of the record too your generous loan to me your crippling interest every single song has like some heart wrenching soul destroying burning just like ah it hurts but yeah wow like just what a great record man what a great impressive well-performed written and produced record from frankly a one-of-a-kind band very sad that uh you know things kind of panned out in the way uh that they did with the departure of isaac but uh once more at least we were able to as the audience share this moment with the band hear this music hear them at some kind of creative peak hopefully this unforeseen change doesn&amp;#39;t really like you know kneecap uh the potential of the group going forward because uh this record is just stellar and if we were to lose you know black country new road uh after this moment that would be a quite the tragedy especially again considering how great this is i mean i i pretty much loved every single song on this thing to some degree there were some spots that ran a little lengthy or a derivative there&amp;#39;s that you know mixing issue on snow globes i wasn&amp;#39;t too nuts about but still i mean i i thought this thing was a uh just great feeling a decent two strong nine on this one tran position have you given this record a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should i review next hit the like

    "transcript": "other boy tano here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new sylvana estrada record marchita this is a brand new lp from mexican vocalist and songwriter sylvana estrada which follows her 2017 record with ciudad de los flores which was more of a latin jazz experience marchita however heads into more of a folk pop and chamber music direction with gentle lovely acoustic tunes topped with really expressive lead vocals whimsical melodies and occasionally some very ornate instrumentation too this thing is just 11 tracks in 37 minutes so not exactly the most intensive listen you&amp;#39;re gonna have this year but sylvana still packs a lot of beauty and a lot of punch into these relatively short direct songs i like to think of them as little acoustic bouquets where sylvana shows a lot of dynamics and restraint for example the intro track masomenos antes really eases you into the record the opening moments instrumentally of this track are so soft you could hear a feather drop into a glass of water but when sylvana pulls out these just heart-wrenching vocal leads just really starts to push on the volume a little bit it cuts deep but again this track is just a taste just the start of the beauty that is going to continue to unfold through the rest of the track list the following track coriente turns the heat up a little bit with some minimal piano accompaniment along with these horns that sync up with sylvanas elegant lead vocals that tell us of these haunting metaphors dealing in the memory of someone in the ocean there&amp;#39;s a tense captivating melancholy to the track that just gets a hold of me very quickly which is even more so the case for tiguardo that features these decimating passages of lyricless croons and weepy strings there&amp;#39;s also this growing sense of unease in the track as this rising flood of piano and strings just builds underneath sylvanas vocals it just kills me the instrumentally ambitious sections of this record are pretty impressive but i&amp;#39;m equally as captivated by some of the simpler spots too like the stomp clap vocal combo of undia cualquiera where sylvana brings a vocal performance that really fills up the open space and you gotta love the soap opera organs and vocal harmonies that bring such a nice a simple but strong climax in the end from here on the record we move into a pretty strong midsection sabre elvidar is a straightforward and again simple folk tune that has a three two four chord progression the soft and sweet guitars on this track are topped with some of the most decisive and authoritative singing and lyrics from sylvana on the record there&amp;#39;s a lot of conviction to her performance on this track and i can hear why with all of her descriptions about desiring to let go of the past and forget about things in her past uh that are haunting her then when the baroque strings come into the mix like ugh i&amp;#39;m melting i feel like i&amp;#39;m having an out of body experience watching myself die in the most artsy tele novella ever the anguish the longing the haunting feelings of love and skin contact continue on to the title track which has some very flashy string arrangements then trista is uh i&amp;#39;ll say this record is one of the most uh pretty portrayals of being down in the dumps i&amp;#39;ve ever heard that being said i don&amp;#39;t know if this track has the strongest progression of the bunch in the tracklist but it&amp;#39;s still a nice listen and also leads us into the final leg of the lp and many of its lyrical themes for example on the song carter that desire to come back together seems to be replaced with the realization that hey maybe um you know uh uh you know rekindling this was a bad idea and that realization kind of brings a freeing and exciting tone to uh the song on this track the bright open landscapes of non-stop violin and aggressively strummed guitar very much feels like yay i&amp;#39;m not caught in this miserable cycle forever yay meanwhile the first half of casa is like this fragmented sparkling bjork inspired meditation that eventually breaks into these massive and thick just dark dark dark dark dark passages of horns and strings then sarah de t is kind of an easy going note for things to end on again a very straightforward folk tune which features the very plain finger picking and middle of the road pacing that was sort of the mark of many indie folk tunes in the 2000s iron and wine fans would eat this up the upright bass and lazy groove on the track are a nice touch as well now narratively the song presents an interesting shift too as in a way it feels almost like an open letter to the other person telling them that hey you know what you you can come back when you like maybe maybe we&amp;#39;ll try this again the emotional push and pull up this record is too much beyond that there&amp;#39;s a beautiful horn outro on this record too that&amp;#39;s quite touching i think uh given the narrative and just everything instrumentally that&amp;#39;s gone on so far an instrumental ending i i think is very very fitting very smart because yeah this record does have good writing good instrumentation and production arrangements all that like all of these great boxes are just being like checked and checked and checked over and over and over but on top of that what makes this record special but it does so well is that it translates very directly very bluntly just like emotion right into sound bam you know you&amp;#39;re getting your emotion right from that sound right from the melodies right from the dynamics of the instrumentation from the vocal performance in such a potent and again direct way but yeah track for track this is a really beautiful wonderful captivating uh lovely record would talk your ear off about it for 10 more minutes if i thought it made sense but look i i love this thing i think it&amp;#39;s great easily going to be one of the best singer songwriter records of the year there were a couple tracks i felt paled in comparison to others but uh you know only by a very very very small degree feeling a light to decent nine on this one tran position have you given this record a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should i review

    "transcript": "um hi everyone destinyqueentano here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a reviews of arca kicks two through five yes this is a brand new series of albums from singer producer songwriter rapper pianist visionary venezuela&amp;#39;s own arca these albums serve as the highly anticipated follow-ups to her uh wonderful kick one album that dropped last year which saw her delivering inventive takes on artpop and latin pop a host of other things too i think arca&amp;#39;s move into more vocal driven music and pop forms has been interesting to say the least especially since her sense of sonic adventure has not been lost in the process and that is especially true of this new batch of records which are a surprise in many ways after kick one we knew kik was going to be a musical series of some sort and it would come to an end eventually but i and many others had no idea all these records were going to collapse onto each other at the end of this year and on top of it an additional one kick five was added on to the list of announced albums so yes four brand new albums dropping all at once uh they range in a time span from like 34 minutes to 42 minutes so nothing too uh time consuming i suppose but all of these records uh range in style aesthetic and intensity i wrestled a lot with how exactly to engage with these projects in this review especially since yes they are separate works but simultaneously they do sort of reinforce each other a bit addressing each album separately in a vacuum in its own review i think wouldn&amp;#39;t make total sense but attempting to rate them and analyze them as a whole doesn&amp;#39;t really make sense either so here&amp;#39;s my plan i&amp;#39;m going to talk about all of these records in this one video in order from my least favorite in the series to my favorite in the series here we go okay so we&amp;#39;re starting with kick 4 here like i said i&amp;#39;m going to talk about these records from my least favorite to my favorite and yes it is true that kick 4 is my least favorite of all of these recently dropped records but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean i don&amp;#39;t like it for the most part i think it&amp;#39;s a decent release kick 4&amp;#39;s easily the dreamiest softest and most serene and melodic of these kik projects a lot of digitally enhanced androgynous croons laced into shimmering beds of synthesizers the song structures on this one are also a bit more loose making it easy for these songs to come together into maybe more of a holistic experience as opposed to looking at each track as an individual statement and over the course of this track list there are some stunningly beautiful highlights the way the breathtaking orchestrations and alien vocal leads intertwine on asuna xenomorph girl features some equally entrancing and wonderful vocal leads but this time paired with some much more mesmerizing beats and i also love the very curious and pitched strange and childlike lead vocals on the song the build of instrumental layers on lost women found are also beautiful but simultaneously make for one of the most immense and powerful moments on the lp as they get so thick and heavy so absolutely there&amp;#39;s highlights on this lp but simultaneously there were some issues that i found as well as i revisited it for one some tracks melodically and structurally come off a bit too vague compositionally there&amp;#39;s not a whole lot to hang on to and in terms of progression they sort of go nowhere fast some of the vocal performances on these songs as well i found to come off a bit too grating considering just how soft and easy going the backing instrumentation was which is especially true of tracks like a witch or even queer for example which uh i wish i liked that track more i appreciate it more in the track list than i did as a single i&amp;#39;ve never really been a huge fan of planning to rock&amp;#39;s vocals but i do you know understand uh what uh you know their significance is to an artist like arca and i think it&amp;#39;s incredible that they crossed over here for sure for this project the song alien inside doesn&amp;#39;t really seem to fit in with the rest of the mood and vibe too some of the harsh sound effects and very assertive spoken word passages uh do feel a bit heavy-handed so again kik4 i think has some really great highlights and i think overall it does achieve a certain aesthetic and stylistic focus for the most part anyway but the songs themselves i found to be kind of a mixed bag i&amp;#39;m feeling a strong six on this one okay next i want to address kick 2 which stylistically i found to be more along the lines of what i was expecting from the kick series given what arca did on kik 1. and for the most part i think it&amp;#39;s pretty on par with that record too kick 2 is also maybe the least conceptually and aesthetically focused of the kick records which seems pretty purposeful as many of the tracks on this thing i think can be digested as individual pieces as opposed to something a part of a larger hole this has led to a lot of tracks that are not only catchy hit hard but work well as singles this is especially true of the songs on this thing where arca finds herself bringing together elements of art pop and reggaeton much in the same way she did on klokay off of kick one with this very futuristic spaced out synth-heavy sound prada rakata tiro and luna yena all bangers in my opinion as i said when i heard kale okay originally i really could do an entire album of this i also find tracks like these to be some of the most necessary that arca does today in terms of a being at the forefront of crafting a sort of post-modern sound in in latin pop but also like kick one on kick two there are these other pieces that are a little short brief half baked and others that that i think defy any kind of conventional appeal sometimes to the point of absurdity like with the fragmented rhythms and warped synth leads on irania which sound almost like they&amp;#39;re trying to parody themselves there are also a few tracks that don&amp;#39;t really feel like they progress past a point of introduction lethargy is an example i love the way that this one flirts with these hip-hop forms and grooves but it just kind of feels too mild across the run of the track and doesn&amp;#39;t really build up in any way significantly i will say this though originally i was not really crazy about born yesterday featuring sia as a single for this project but hearing it in the context of the record i enjoyed a lot more especially considering how much more i guess accessible it is than a lot of other stuff here and having heard an entire record of this style of production up to this point uh it does sort of solidify arca&amp;#39;s you know imprint and influence on the song itself even if c is kind of dominating uh vocally on the track so while kik 2 i found to be a little all over the place and a bit inconsistent it is equal parts exhilarating and perplexing i&amp;#39;m feeling a light seven on this one next let&amp;#39;s talk about kick five probably the biggest grower for me in the kick series not only because it was added on later but it&amp;#39;s easily the most understated of all the kicks if anything defines this album i think it&amp;#39;s a minimal approach which for arca is certainly saying something since much of her music has this tendency to be very dense be very glitchy be very disorienting and difficult to wrap your mind around so how would an arca album sound if you stripped it back to musically its most basic and simplest elements the answer is pretty beautiful arca&amp;#39;s knowledge of ambient textures and classical keys are on full display on this lp there are some tracks that run a little brief or fall into some of the same somewhat uh grating potholes that uh songs on kik4 did but the plucky glossy and classically influenced keys on estrogen are gorgeous as are the equally bare pianos on ether the cycling and increasingly distorted synth arpeggios on amrep not only remind me of the early work of aphex twin but are pretty mesmerizing too while tierno&amp;#39;s gentle chords and lead vocals feel like a more fully realized version of what arca was doing on her self-titled record in 2017. a couple tracks on the back end see arca exploring more spacious textures the song la infinite does feel infinite to a degree with just this deep cavernous reverb soaking much of the instrumentation here but the composition at the core of it doesn&amp;#39;t feel as grand as the space that it is locked into however i think fire prayer has a much more gratifying climax with some classical piano roaring through all of these tension building layers of synthesizers there are some slightly underwhelming moments here and while i do appreciate the more minimal direction and ambient direction of this record it does seem like arca kind of struggles to find a cohesive way to go about implementing that sound across the entire lp it&amp;#39;s kind of like we get a little bit of a taste of it in one way here a little bit of another taste of it there i also think the somewhat glitchy closer feels like something that would have been more appropriate for kick two as opposed to five but overall i still found the vast majority of the tracks on this thing beautiful and uh thought that this record was easily one of the more compelling uh in the kick series i&amp;#39;m feeling a decent two strong seven on this one i feel like i&amp;#39;m speed running this review all right kick three easily my favorite of the kick records and one of my favorite records of the year as well what&amp;#39;s funny is i love it so much and uh simultaneously i have a hard time putting this record into words but what is clear is this album hunkers down on a lot of the hip-hop influences club influences glitch influences and industrial influences that defined a lot of arca&amp;#39;s early work from those stretch eps and stuff that she had done for like kanye west seasons so all those styles are in full effect here once again but now they&amp;#39;re really really really being pushed to the brink in such a way where i think kick 3 is the most explosive visceral and show-stopping project arca has ever done really career defining in my opinion i think this record&amp;#39;s an improvement on a lot of things for arca as well for one on the opener bruja arca&amp;#39;s rapping abilities have solidified quite a bit since that first kick lp she sounds so great confident and charismatic on these fragmented clubby beats loaded with all of these harsh and dystopian perks the howling vocals and synthesizers over the bridge of the track as well make me feel like i&amp;#39;m being possessed the following cut also hits some really high intensity points as well with a horrifyingly industrial twist on again these very club-friendly rhythms in many ways the song fiera feels like a futuristic step past all of these loose woozy wonky grooves that have defined so many classics off of the brain feeder records catalog meanwhile skull queen and elektra rex push the album&amp;#39;s limits of hyperactivity speedy beats and jittery vocals and sound effects that feel like i&amp;#39;ve just drank way too many energy drinks i&amp;#39;m also reminded of richard d james a little bit uh in this portion of the record skull queen feels like i&amp;#39;m listening to a classic aphex beat but with someone hyperventilating over it the track ripples features all these unsettling hyper wraps over some dizzying glitchy beats think of any number of tracks off of like sophie&amp;#39;s wonderful project uh product but uh take everything that was disorienting about those songs and multiply it by 10. all the scuzzy distorted synthesizers and bits of percussion feel like binary code is being violently downloaded into my brain senorita is easily hands down the biggest and best industrial rap banger i&amp;#39;ve heard this year death grips eat your [ __ ] heart out what a groove man the drums are massive and the glitchy enhancements on arko&amp;#39;s vocals are incredible like this track among many others hits so hard and there&amp;#39;s also this amazing attention to detail i was also surprised to see a co-credit from machine drum on the cut two from here we move into a pretty impressive final leg where arca continues the sensory overload experience all of the insane layers of vocal chatter in the second half of my two are equally maddening and exciting while intimate flesh is one of the most bassy and sensual cuts on the entire lp and speaks a lot to this album&amp;#39;s overall themes of hedonism sex and sexuality i also find it interesting how the vocal layers on this one are very manipulated and pretty strange as well but they come together in a way that&amp;#39;s more mesmerizing than they even are on some of the more subtle cuts in the kick series and with hoya i don&amp;#39;t think i could have asked for a better calm after the storm of this entire record the song features a lot of very beautiful sparkling synth passages and some of the most angelic vocals on all of the kick records outside of maybe a few tracks not feeling as intense as others my mind was absolutely blown by this record from first listen and continues to be as i listen to it again and again and again this is my favorite of the kick albums and just an incredible feat for arca creatively i&amp;#39;m feeling a decent two strong nine on this one and while i do feel the strongest about kick three that&amp;#39;s not to totally single that project out as uh being way more superior than everything else here because i still do at the end of the day see it as a part of the kick series as a whole and i think all five of these albums coming together uh really assemble into an incredible era and body of work for arca uh that not only feels like you know a high point for her creatively but also has me really excited to see what the future for her music is going to be because she already sounds and feels so ahead of the curve in so many ways like what arca&amp;#39;s music could possibly sound like over the next three to five years is just uh out of the realm of my imagination i think but yes some really incredible groundbreaking and significant work from arca in these records and uh incredible that she was able to come together complete all of these albums have all of them coming through with a distinct sound and personality and uh what she accomplished here is just really uh commendable regardless of what you know my or anybody&amp;#39;s you know individual feelings are on uh any one single of these records so uh yeah i think that&amp;#39;s uh you know everything i have to say about uh these albums uh rated them talked about them got my opinions out there about them let me know what yours are down in the comments and i will see you guys in the next review tran position have you given these albums a listen did

    "transcript": "hi everyone anthony cartano here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of the new richard dawson and circle album henke this is a brand new lp from uk singer songwriter richard dawson who is teaming up with the finnish rock band circle on this new one an experimental and progressive band that&amp;#39;s been putting out records since about the early 90s dawson actually teased this kind of surprising crossover in a recent interview i did with him uh where he said this new record would lean kind of progressive and and boy was he not lying i mean stylistically that&amp;#39;s really uh circles bread and butter but dawson himself is no stranger to working loads of experimental and progressive influences into his very left field brand of folk music as well his last proper album the dystopian pre-pandemic prediction that he came out with in 2019 which was titled 2020 which i guess was just a little bit off in terms of predicting just how awful the immediate future would be it turns out the picture he painted could have just been a lot grimmer but instrumentally some of the tracks on this record were some of dawson&amp;#39;s most rock inspired so far and there was also the uh lockdown album he came out with the republic of geordi land which had some pretty abstract but somewhat unrealized ideas all over it too so now from there we are on to this new record with circle and on it we pretty much get dawson&amp;#39;s enchanting style of songwriting and very eccentric topic choices his strange but passionate lead vocals too backed now with a full nerd prague arsenal of guitars bass drums synths some electronics as well and the whole thing is fantastic featuring the seven lengthy tracks with intriguing stories packed into each of them i think this record also serves as a reminder of progressive rock&amp;#39;s original mission not just to attain some certain level of technical proficiency but also to break and advance past the conventions of rock and popular music and while these seven tracks are quite anthemic and do sit on some tried and true tropes they&amp;#39;re far from conventional the opening track cooksonia is titled after a genus of extinct land plants and is essentially a story about a botanist&amp;#39;s upbringing and education then eventually leading to this tragic outing where they and another botanist are traveling with some specimens that are deteriorating as they leave the country the whole story of the song ending in this picture of desolation and of course the whole tale is soundtracked by these meditative and primal drums grim guitar strumming some sparkling synth passages too to break the tension not to mention the finish of the track escalates into this wall of psychedelic fuzzy folk and this song overall is a very easy going but emotional start to a record that gets more adventurous and urgent as it continues the song ivy for example is a multiverse epic that touches down on a few different narrative points of greek mythology but the whole thing seems mostly in reference to the seder silenus who eventually gives the power to turn whatever he wanted by touch to gold to king midas which if you&amp;#39;re familiar with that story you know how tragically that ends and the music complementing this track is as dark grand and archaic as i could have hoped for especially in the first leg with it sounding like the soundtrack to a medieval dungeon plus i love that dawson hits us with these preposterous but uh kind of amazing falsettos the whole thing gets even better as the rhythms and riffs pick up around the midpoint where the story gets kind of treacherous around a stoning and some travel at sea the greek tie-ins continue on the record with the track silphium with mentions of apollonia and cyrene the story itself seems to feature merchants or travelers on a tiring journey where they are lost and running out of food or just not eating the best of food and outside of dawson&amp;#39;s falsettos hitting a little weak on the front end the whole first leg of the track is a throttling thrill ride where the dire circumstances of the protagonists in the story translates really clearly in the middle of the track there&amp;#39;s also a sudden jazz rock break that goes over really well with the original riffs and rhythms coming back for a finale on the back end cylene is a more meditative cut by comparison with everything else here with these very repetitive guitars and pulsating electronics and i appreciate the whole thing more in concept than i do in practice because there are multiple passages where dawson and circle throw on top of this rhythm section some vocal layers and melodies that seem almost at odds with the instrumentation below which i&amp;#39;m sure to a degree was intentional as it is a bit jarring and everything else on the record is so cohesive by comparison but i&amp;#39;m not really sure if the effect they were going for really came through but the last several songs on the record are some of the strongest here the plant themes on the lp continue with the track methuselah which is not only the name of one of the biggest sequoias on earth but the track also seems to be a story about donald rusk curry a researcher and geographer who was known for in the 60s having accidentally killed what&amp;#39;s known to be the oldest living tree the lyrics of the track give a detailed description as to how this happened and then immediately after this realization hits him uh the whole thing breaks into this pandora&amp;#39;s box of uh frightening refrains and riffs it gets really grim lily is probably the most straightforward and clean cut structurally on the entire lp the hook hits really hard on this one and with immediacy now don&amp;#39;t get me wrong some of the group vocals on this thing are pretty theatrical and campy and dawson&amp;#39;s falsettos won&amp;#39;t be for everybody it is weird but it&amp;#39;s still quite catchy even with some of the operatic vocals on the bridge and the lyrics being as morbid as they are then the closing track i really enjoyed i thought was a rockin and triumphant finish for the whole thing comes to a really amazing vocal and instrumental climax toward the end too with a circle really going absolutely insane really making some of the most wild and raw prague music i&amp;#39;ve heard in a while i mean yeah i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;m heavily impressed with this record it&amp;#39;s so good the songwriting the production the performances it&amp;#39;s just all great so full of personality so colorful and uh and so unique lyrically and conceptually i think dawson hits it out of the park once again and it just so happens that circle was the perfect accompaniment to the whole thing i&amp;#39;m feeling a strong eight to a light nine on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don&amp;#39;t cry hit the bell as well over

rapper producer singer songwriter the left-wing hades a.k.a jpeg mafia following up the beloved 2019 record all my heroes are cornballs which saw a modest shift in peggy&amp;#39;s style toward more pop and r b melodies and while i did prefer his breakout record veteran to that one he still continued to push forward artistically on some subsequent eps ep1 and ep2 the former of which contained some of his best bangers to date then the latter had more mellow melodic cloudy cuts on it that have come together into one of my favorite eps of the year and then there&amp;#39;s lp which in my opinion feels like artistically everything peggy has been honing up until this point experimental abstract lo-fi hip-hop glitch hop with again now more touches of pop and r b and now peggy&amp;#39;s even whipping up beats that have more of a hardcore hip-hop flavor or rock flavor to them his versatility continues to amaze but what i love even more about this project is that he&amp;#39;s recaptured that unpredictable energy that made veterans such a guessing game for me and many other fans it should also be noted that there are two versions of this project too a version you can find on just about every streaming service out there and a more offline version that&amp;#39;s floating around bandcamp right now both versions feature different tracks different track lists some tweaked instrumentals or song structures i i assume because of like sample clearance reasons the differences between these projects aren&amp;#39;t night and day but they are there and while the streaming version does have bops on it like bald and cutie pie i see those more as ep 1 cuts anyway and ultimately tracks like hazard duty pay from the offline version are kind of highlights that i wouldn&amp;#39;t want to go without now i will say the streaming version does have its merits too this version of the project is more concise which is not a bad thing and on top of it the ghost of ranking dread with its very grim and shimmering wall of synthesizers and guitars at the end brings a greater sense of finality to the end of the record if we&amp;#39;re you know taking songs like cutie pie and bald as mere extras and i also think damn damn damn makes more sense in the middle of the lp than toward the end too once more i prefer the offline version that&amp;#39;s the one it seems that peggy had to change around or alter the least but whatever one you want to listen to is whatever so in my opinion lp&amp;#39;s most exciting qualities are that it is volatile and versatile sonically and emotionally this thing is difficult to pin down in only the way that peggy&amp;#39;s music is right now at one point on this record he says these days the bar so low for weird [ __ ] i had to stop sharing which is absolutely true even truer white boys beyond a burner so they think they scared but really the risk-taking and the weirdo attitude that peggy exudes on this record is just so unparalleled and that&amp;#39;s been the case for a while but i think it becomes even clearer as a result of lp being out and what&amp;#39;s funny is this record is so odd it&amp;#39;s so out there and it&amp;#39;s filled with so many unlikely combinations of sounds and ideas and yet it&amp;#39;s still so incredibly catchy and there are tons of moments on this thing that stick with me even after an initial listen whether that&amp;#39;s the opening track trust which is loaded with these uh feel-good rhymes with a chill delivery floating on top of these twinkling hyperactive synthesizers it kind of sounds like a beat that you&amp;#39;d find on some obscure soundcloud producers page that&amp;#39;s packed with anime images and that together with peggy&amp;#39;s voice makes for an incredible contrast of energies there are also loads of memorable bars on the second verse of the second track dirty where peggy is taking down very pointedly trend dependent artists their filler lines their tacky production and doing it all over these glitchy synthesizers these industrially tinged heavy rhythms the whole beat sounds like peggy made it on a [ __ ] lathe then nemo was so harsh and preposterous sonically and lyrically i i don&amp;#39;t know how i couldn&amp;#39;t be in awe of it the track makes most glitch hops sound normal and there are plenty of other spots on this lp that are incredibly smooth and accessible like with the luxurious r b instrumentation and soaring vocals on hazard duty pay which pairs very well with peggy&amp;#39;s forceful flow and blunt bars there&amp;#39;s also the mysterious and beautiful thoughts prayer uh here peggy is as i was saying earlier interpolating britney spears and he&amp;#39;s no stranger to covering or doing an artistic nod to 2000&amp;#39;s era pop but in my opinion this track&amp;#39;s probably the best example of that he&amp;#39;s done britney&amp;#39;s original flow and lyrics are given a strange new life within this spacious woozy beat meanwhile what kind of wrapping is this is a heavenly cut featuring these swirling wonderful harps and gorgeous vocal samples sounds like a fusion of triphop and r b from the future then peggy&amp;#39;s bars on the track are pretty much cheeky commentary about the quality of a lot of hip hop lyricism today the novelty of his style how long he&amp;#39;s been at it the whole track is euphoric funny and effortlessly charming are you happy sees things shifting on this lp into more of a grimy old-school memphis vibe but with some weird post-modern glitches laced into the beat from front to back the whole thing is pretty much proof of how entrancing and surreal peggy&amp;#39;s songwriting and production can get when he wants it to be however the song rebound is very different in that it is totally out for blood not only is this one of the hardest jpeg mafia beats ever with its gigantic drums eerie tones and grand horns but there&amp;#39;s also a great feature from dapif mafia that coincides with a slight bassy beat switch and merciless bars from peggy 2 why would i pray for your health baby i pray for myself then it would seem the final verse of the track addresses uh some personal beef that peggy seems really passionate about from here we move into the second half of the project which in my opinion is just as strong as the first the song og features some hilariously sassy bars from peggy some classic hip-hop rhythms and a sample of just ices the original gangster of hip-hop the whole track successfully pulls off having a foot in the old and the foot in the new it&amp;#39;s like a post-industrial trippy hardcore hip-hop it almost reminds me in a way aesthetically of uh that wonderful beastie boys record i love so much that&amp;#39;s a freaking underrated as [ __ ] hello nasty then the glossy tired nervous and broke has one of the strongest choruses on the entire lp really shows that peggy knows his way around a hook when he wants to pull one off but what&amp;#39;s funny is that i&amp;#39;m not even sure if the song is as catchy or as compelling as the somber uh raw piano outro featured on the track uh sung by peggy and obviously a guest who i guess is miraculously kimbra kimbra but yeah that portion of the song is just so goddamn cutting emotionally it&amp;#39;s like your favorite saddest radiohead song then there&amp;#39;s the inventive bmt which brings together this super compressed distorted lo-fi hip-hop beat some military march calls and some marimba as well it&amp;#39;s an insane collection of vibes and it all pairs again perfectly with peggy&amp;#39;s voice which cuts very well through all the chaos the ghost of ranking dread is easily one of the most epic and linear songs on the entire record i love tk mize&amp;#39;s very alluring and somewhat eerie vocals on the front end which are touched up with auto-tune and harmonized in a way where they feel kind of strange and robotic eventually all this builds up to a very futuristic palette a wall of sound that wall that i referred to earlier with the synths and guitars layering up in a somewhat hellish and dystopian way peggy really nailing the sound design and the structure on this track wonderfully this is honestly like some left field sci-fi netflix series type [ __ ] then there&amp;#39;s untitled which isn&amp;#39;t uh as bold or as strong as showing instrumentally but i still think is a somewhat fitting closer because peggy does leave us with a parting flex and some words of wisdom so yeah there are tons of great tracks on this thing great verses great vocal performances great production great songwriting it&amp;#39;s so flavorful it&amp;#39;s so bold i do have a few critiques of the whole thing overall because i do think the flow of the record is a tad bit choppy there are some breezy instrumental bits that as i go back and i listen to the lp maybe aren&amp;#39;t as striking or aren&amp;#39;t as engaging as some of the core songs i also found um end credits to be maybe a bit too scant a bit too fleeting of a moment but i still see lp as an improvement on a lot of fronts peggy is getting better at writing biting lyrics employing song structure when he needs to the production here is easily more boundary pushing uh the track list is pretty stacked with weirdo hits on top of weirdo hits it&amp;#39;s so layered and detailed as well every time i listen to it another bar or another like instrumental bit or nuance sticks out yeah with lp i think peggy continues to you know just flex his abilities as just being a jack of all trades a guy who&amp;#39;s a rapper a singer a songwriter a producer just a little bit of everything and doing all of it incredibly well i&amp;#39;m feeling a light too decent nine on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should i review next hit the like if

    "transcript": "hi everyone Anthony fantano here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of this new injury reserve project by the time I get to Phoenix this is the latest project from Phoenix hip hop outfit injury reserve their second Studio LP to date following up their self-titled in 2019 which was officially their debut though it did come after years of fan favorite mixtapes and the drive it like it&amp;#39;s stolen EP I&amp;#39;ve been following injury reserves ride since the release of early singles that preceded their live from the dentist breakout mixtape and it&amp;#39;s been exciting to see them progress artistically but also disheartening to see their fun and Forward Thinking approach to rap music fall on deaf ears within much of the industry that self-title definitely did make a dent forcing many outlets to really pay attention to them with some more accessible tracks and bigger features though personally I don&amp;#39;t think it lived up to be their best workto date now under normal conditions any other group most likely would have built off the Rapport and momentum set by that record with a new release but the pandemic year a darker world and the untimely passing of key member Jordan Alexander grogs has put injury reserve in an unforeseen position where the you know future of the group is pretty much up in the air right now but in an interview I had with remaining members Nathaniel Richie and Parker Corey they said they finished much of the lp before all of this and because of its dark and Abstract Direction it still felt fitting to put out and that&amp;#39;s certainly what the singles teased toward as well there was the heart-wrenching knees which brought these Stark hits of guitars and drums over which Richie brings this pained and ghostly vocal delivery that blurs the lines between the performance style of a rapper an R&amp;amp;B artist and a rock frontman the track even blurs the boundaries of uh what is I guess a song as there are moments here where Richie&amp;#39;s lyrics and vocals feel less like a performance and more like an internal monologue wrapped in off-kilter rhythms glitchy effects and disorienting vocal samples as a whole though the song feels like singing a very quiet song to yourself at a point where where you are at your lowest while also dealing with a pounding headache then there was also Superman that which was even more disorienting in comparison with its wild frantic glitchy rhythms that are still baffling to me at this point in one breath feel like I&amp;#39;m listening to a more direct and pummeling version of something off of an ARCA record one of her more I guess uh deconstructed and glitch oriented projects while Richie&amp;#39;s vocals in the midst of this chaos are giving off this ranting raving autotuned 808s and heartbreak Kanye level energy the ending of the track is a little abrupt but the ride up until that point is completely dizzying overwhelming too but in the midst of of all of this injury reserve still manages to convey some very potent emotions like the song knes this track brings I think some really serious feelings of helplessness or even impending doom so with teaser tracks with singles like these I went into this album wondering is every track going to be this like left field and by the time I get to Phoenix is almost more out there than I anticipated it would be to the point where I find some pockets of the record groundbreaking and a little difficult to Define so there&amp;#39;s outside the intro track which is a pretty mysterious beginning to the record and feels like I&amp;#39;m listening to a dystopian rap battle SLS spoken word piece the stage is set with some sampled bars from New York Battle Rapper dot then immediately after Richie comes in rapping against that with his vocals pitched down almost as if he is performing in response but not literally it&amp;#39;s not like he&amp;#39;s going at the guy or anything like that I I think this is sort of setting the stage on this track in order to illustrate these themes of division expressed throughout the song it&amp;#39;s a really immense intro to the record and I think speaks to the direness of our current times and I think speaks to the emotional heaviness of this record overall as well as it very much feels like I&amp;#39;m staring into a black hole that I&amp;#39;m slowly getting sucked into SS San Francisco with z- Loopers is also a serious head scratcher the instrumental on this one sounds like I&amp;#39;m listening to some depressive rockabilly or uh maybe even some Tom weights from like the bone machine ERA with its twangy and strange guitar leads and brooding bass meanwhile the vocals Richie and Z Loopers throw on top are bringing cross-sections of Psych and blues and experimental Rock then the following rap verses that pop in are the epitome of abstract hip-hop with Illusions to just how dark the world is right now but also with that train of thought being constantly interrupted with other musings and happenings and I guess you know just things trailing off a little bit mentally the song itself Trails off a little bit in the end but as I listen to it and also enjoy it I do kind of wonder what is even the most reasonable way to end this because as I dig deeper into this record not only does it feel like a lot of it is in reaction to the disarray of the world but also the disarray of the self the song footwork in a forest fire starts off well enough with the dreary Loi guitar and drum Loops grogg&amp;#39;s Wild verse on the front end of the song is incredible feels like a more extreme take on the freakier directions Kanye was going in vocally on yeus though I do think the song begins to lose some steam in the second half especially with that uh guitar Loop and drum Loop staling out a little bit truth be told this is maybe the least Dynamic instrumental on the record thus far so as a result I think Richie&amp;#39;s performance on the song doesn&amp;#39;t come off as refreshing as it should though I do kind of like the way the song melts and disintegrates on the back end it does bring some cool soundplay to the table and I have no doubt with the title in mind here uh injury reserve was overtly referencing the highly publicized forest fires that have been raging across the planet and intensifying as a result of climate change the song Ground Zero philosophically in terms of its title I think is very much pulling from a similar type of energy maybe it&amp;#39;s not directly in reference to 911 or anything like that but when we use terminology like Ground Zero we&amp;#39;re often talking about a location where something catastropic happens instrumentally the track brings these heavy warped descending tones stuttering rhythms a very lowkey delivery from Richie as well he kind of mutters his way through these somewhat violent and very materialistic bars I do like the vibe and the sentiment of the song overall how it fits into the record but I do wish it had a stronger progression to it then smoke don&amp;#39;t clear is another moment where oddly enough I&amp;#39;m kind of reminded of Tom weights once again but like a totally different era like the real gone ERA with all these distorted looped hip-hop influence beats then there&amp;#39;s also Richie&amp;#39;s purposefully Gravely and very over-the-top delivery on it then with all the fuzzy textures and Primal rhythms in the instrumental 2o it&amp;#39;s just another spot where injury reserve is just unabashedly throwing me for a loop then top picks for you once again again pulls deeply from that 808s and heartbreak era but then goes a bit more abstract with it with this strange wintry and vast soundscape then we have Richie on top of this delivering this blend of rap and spoken word with some haunting and ingenious Reflections on death and existential patterns likening the sequences that you might see in a life cycle to that of an Internet algorithm which honestly I think makes for one of the most apt moments conceptually on the entire project I think Wild Wild West also expands on this project themes of technology and apocalypse 2o with Richie on this instrumental ranting madly about 5G towers and bars like Willie Smith with the Inspector Gadget is more than just like a funny jux position as these things are brought up in reference to spying and intrusion this may also work as a meta commentary on the growing presence of conspiracies in popular and social media then post postpartum is another spot instrumentally that I get a lot out of it feels like an experiment m al post-industrial take on the Soulful sweet psychedelic sounds of outcast aesthetically I think it also sets the stage really well for the following track knes and conceptually I think this track is a hilarious way for uh injury reserve to kind of claim their influence with Richie saying his and their artistic impact is uh you know leading to them a birthing dudes really going into that with a lot of passion and detail and I think the extra level of hilarity with that on this track is everything injury reserve is pulling off on this record is just so far off from what like uh a trend seeking or a desperate for attention artist would want to copycat or even be able to copy cat honestly then we have the closing Track by storm which I think leaves the record off with a glimmer of hope in a way the instrumental here is rooted in these really fuzzy driving bits of guitar and bass in fact is a sample lifted from the closing track to one of my favorite Brian Eno records here come the warm Jets on top of that Richie is talking about uh you know that old adage when it rains it pours and it&amp;#39;s really pouring and uh given the global events of the past couple of years and again injury reserve losing a key member I would say that is in fact the case but as Richie States on this track The Show Must Go On And even though things do look really dark there is kind of like a you know willingness to continue and a hopefulness to uh the vibe here that I I think is unignorable even if it&amp;#39;s not said as as explicitly as it could be so overall uh I walked away from this record really blown away and impressed this thing is a bold inventive and I think genre bending and blurring project really one of the first records in hip-hop since the release of like deathgrips early stuff that uh to my ears feels like you know this is like transcending the the hip-hop genre a little bit but also kind of just expanding it as well I find it relatively refreshing that this record overall is a pretty compact listening experience but by that same token there are some ideas instrumentally and sonically I think could have been teased out developed a little bit further explored a bit deeper in terms of like length on a track or more variation within what has already been presented there are moments when Phoenix I think is a bit too brief but despite those very minor shortcomings This Record is the experimental out there abstract hip-hop release that I think everybody should be listening to this year if that is a direction that you happen to find yourself going into at any point because this is just great in my opinion it totally blows their self-titled project out of the water and simultaneously feels so familiar but also so different to feeling a strong eight to a light nine on this one transition have you given this

    "transcript": "hi everyone here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of the new floating points and pharaoh sanders record promises featuring the london symphony orchestra this is a collaboration between not one not two but kind of three amazing names in the world of music one samuel t shepherd aka floating points a uk electronic music producer whose short but eclectic discography is known not just to cover idm and progressive electronic music but also classical and jazz as well two saxophonist pharaoh sanders one of the true living legends of jazz has played with numerous greats across his career and is mostly known for his contributions to spiritual jazz so through some amazing alignment of the stars these two have crossed over and then decided a pivotal tool to help their collaboration flourish would be the london symphony orchestra and of course it&amp;#39;s been released on the record label that david byrne started in the late 80s to release brazilian and latin music that he was obsessed with at the time as well as his own solo stuff and yes the label has dropped a ton of great music in a variety of genres over the years i just thought this was something that you should know so yes on promises what we essentially have is a very unlikely cross-section of figures creating a meditative multi-movement new jazz piece with an orchestral twist and let me specify that one more time we have one piece on this record going through multiple movements i point that out because this piece moves through what is essentially the same cycle of cords for its 47-minute run time but breaks this progression up with different instrumental palettes and movements over this theme so for one movement the keys may be more prominent for another the sax for yet another the strings true to sanders spiritual jazz roots it&amp;#39;s pretty entrancing in other words it&amp;#39;s a vibe but it&amp;#39;s also more than that often in my reviews i will cite instances on a song on a section of a song where there&amp;#39;s a lot of movement a great progression but what can also be great is when a piece of music has an alluring stillness to it a sense of place artists who achieve this tend to hang more in the ambient and experimental realms but not always and there are points where promises does throw caution to the wind but for the most part this is a very stable composition whose magic is displayed through these immensely beautiful instrumental shifts that i think will woo nearly any music listener there&amp;#39;s also a cleanliness a clarity a pristine quality to the sound of this project which i sort of expected given the london symphony orchestra tie-in but it doesn&amp;#39;t take away from the heart and the soul of the peace in my opinion and for the most part complements the more electronic aesthetics of the piece too the whole thing kicks off with this beautiful first movement that works in two parts essentially an introduction to the foundational chords of the piece repeating them to the point where the listener may feel like they&amp;#39;re being just brought into a lull a sense of serenity or familiarity and then pharaoh sanders begins running through an expressive passionate sac solo for the next five minutes i know this is just the first step of the record but between these glossy keys and sanders course but dynamic sax playing this is a sound i just want to be lost in even at this point there is a weightlessness and a vastness to promises that uh puts me in a state of just feeling like uh i&amp;#39;m spinning through a a starry open space i don&amp;#39;t know what is up and what is down the introduction of strings and electronics make the next couple of shorter movements in this piece melt into each other nicely the core musical theme of the piece remains strong and clear and constant meanwhile shepard and sanders and the orchestra are subtly diversifying the instrumental palettes movement four of the piece brings on some oddly intimate humming and vocalizations for a moment it&amp;#39;s uh interesting how this changes up the vibe of everything so instantaneously because everything of it so far feels so isolated but there&amp;#39;s kind of like a warmth to that moment that just makes it feel uh not so um lonely the fiery sax playing that comes later in this particular movement is a lot darker relies on deeper heavier tones this smoothly transitions into movement 5 which gets a little chaotic it&amp;#39;s like everything we&amp;#39;ve been hearing up until this point but the chaos of the previous movement has brought all of these elements up to a boiling point there&amp;#39;s more blending and bleeding and volatility i feel like i&amp;#39;m listening to the musical equivalent to a chemical reaction all of the elements here are turning into a steamy soup of sound on movement six much of the base instrumentation flushes out to really give a spotlight to the strings there are some heavy immense dense passages of music on this one that i love the bright orchestral arrangements really do make for a climactic moment movement 7 tones things down for some spacey ambient electronics that cycle into infinity then we get a radical but simple change on the eighth movement where pretty much everything is replaced with a very dirty organ but the isolation of the organ in this spot does allow for creative musical embellishments on the chords we&amp;#39;ve been hearing so far in many ways the ninth and final movement of the piece is even more low-key you can tell shepard and sanders are really trying to ease us out of this experience the orchestrations come back it&amp;#39;s very delicate it&amp;#39;s quite cinematic and in a nutshell that is the piece that is promises and it&amp;#39;s quite lovely it&amp;#39;s really one of the best musical experiences i&amp;#39;ve had this year there are some movements i think could have used a bit more variation but as is the mix the instrumentation here is gorgeous is immaculate the whole experience again is truly meditative and entrancing and creatively speaking this project is a cool cross-section of jazz electronic music and classical without any one of those elements being to the detriment of the other feeling a light to decent nine on this one tran position have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and

    "transcript": "this is gonna be a tough review for me this album that i&amp;#39;m gonna talk about brings out some very emotional parts of me that i didn&amp;#39;t think was gonna happen so full disclosure on that so ichiko aoba she&amp;#39;s a japanese folk singer that i&amp;#39;ve been hearing about within the last couple of months um a friend of mine recommended her album from about seven years ago called zero and i really enjoyed that a lot um i&amp;#39;ve seen some of her live performances on youtube she just put out a live album earlier this year that was really good from her studio albums compared to her live albums i did not realize how much of a powerful voice she has because her studio albums are very minimal it&amp;#39;s bare bones production it&amp;#39;s japanese folk singer songwriter that kind of stuff i didn&amp;#39;t think i was going to be into that once i was first recommended it but the one two punch of hearing zero and then this live album from earlier this year really left a mark and i was really really impressed and then just this past friday she put out an album called windswept adam which that&amp;#39;s translated from english i&amp;#39;m not sure how to say it and i really don&amp;#39;t know what to say it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s beautiful throughout my serious listening phase and reviewing and writing just now making these videos very few albums have been able to give me a vivid image of what i&amp;#39;m hearing this entire album i&amp;#39;m picturing myself laying in my bed and just staring out the window and there&amp;#39;s a pond and then there&amp;#39;s these blossoming pink cherry trees going just blooming up and it&amp;#39;s a beautiful it&amp;#39;s a perfect aesthetic and along with that there is like you could i also imagine being near an ocean and hearing the crashing waves which actually closes out the album and i did not know that um there are different wildlife sounds throughout the album which add to that and there are also these little ambient interludes where aoba is just riffing vocally over these and it&amp;#39;s beautiful it all adds to this atmosphere of just nothing except you and an accused guitar just like zero um aoba&amp;#39;s delicate voice is accompanied by these really lush instrumentals it just sounds really really pretty it feels i would say that it&amp;#39;s low-fi but if this was if this was considered to be lo-fi this would be some of the best low-fi music i&amp;#39;ve ever heard period bar none but it doesn&amp;#39;t have that static that you hear with lo-fi music because you can hear every little detail possible big problem that i would have had with this is the vocals well technically the vocal sounds beautiful but i don&amp;#39;t know the japanese language i&amp;#39;m currently learning it i i am on no level to understand the language just yet but this her vocals have this hefty hefty amount of emotion it transcends language i don&amp;#39;t know the exact word she&amp;#39;s saying but you can feel those emotions that she&amp;#39;s saying and nearly every melody every guitar player every guitar pick every instrument instrument you can hear on this is clean and crisp and it&amp;#39;s beautiful in a world with so much chaos and confusion i was in a bit of a dark place i lost a friend earlier this year i don&amp;#39;t i&amp;#39;m not going to get into the details i&amp;#39;m not i&amp;#39;m not that kind of person but we&amp;#39;re just going to leave that i lost a friend and before this person was gone i didn&amp;#39;t really realize how much of an impact that this person had on me and when they were gone it took a toll on me it it [ __ ] me up and there was and this album felt like a message from the beyond telling me that everything was gonna be okay for some reason i connected with this album like that i don&amp;#39;t know why i did i specifically the song um chino kaze i don&amp;#39;t know if i&amp;#39;m saying that right but it is about the 10th track on the album chino kaze and it just hit me hard i when this song chino cause i hit the crescendo i just started sobbing i at the moment in the moment i didn&amp;#39;t realize why i was thinking about this i did not think about how impactful listening to an album like this would be for me and for my mental state i should probably wrap this up because if i&amp;#39;m gonna continue on like this i&amp;#39;m just gonna break into tears man well it&amp;#39;s hard to sum up this review as i&amp;#39;ve shared my emotions and they my emotions come into play with this kind of album that i didn&amp;#39;t expect but i can&amp;#39;t even talk windswept a dad is a full-on immersive magnificent masterpiece it is some of the most otherworldly music i&amp;#39;ve ever heard this is a mind-blowingly immersive album and i would like to commend ichiko ayoba the all of the dedication in the world and all of my love for this album i did not expect to come in like this and get emotional i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;m not crying right now but if i was just talking to myself like this i i would be but i&amp;#39;m not right now i&amp;#39;m trying to hold it back and it is really tough um i mean wind swept a dawn or a dan whatever this is this decade&amp;#39;s first true masterpiece after even a couple listens i can say that ichiko ayoba&amp;#39;s windswept at dawn is one of my favorite albums of all time and the best album of 2020. so silly me i forgot to give a rating for this review so based on what i said i think it&amp;#39;s safe to say that this was a 10 out of 10 album and also i recorded this two days later from this this my opinions still stand and that&amp;#39;s gonna do it for this review if you liked it leave a like obviously subscribe for more content on the side it help it helps the channel in the long run and it is totally free also feel free to leave a comment on what i should do a video on next i&amp;#39;m not exclusive to reviewing recently released

    "transcript": "hi everyone spookthenebu tano here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it&amp;#39;s time for a review of the new clipping album visions of bodies being burned titled after a bar from the ghetto boys song mind playing tricks on me which is sampled in the second track of this album visions of bodies being burned is essentially the sister record to clippings last full-length lp one year ago it was dropped there existed in addiction to blood which thematically was a hard turn into horror core territory while still maintaining their harsh and creative approach to sound now this horror core switch-up also manifested in the embrace of some horror movie soundtrack aesthetics there were some instrumentals on this thing that had some serious john carpenter vibes but the trio also took their sound play to the next level 2 on some tracks whether that&amp;#39;s on run for your life where there&amp;#39;s all sorts of sound effects indicating that rapper david diggs is spitting his bars outside including a moment where a car is driving by a beat is playing out the window and that beat just happens to sync up with the rhythm of his rhymes then there was also piano burning which was a take on anil lockwood&amp;#39;s conceptual piano burning performance pieces and yeah it&amp;#39;s literally audio of a piano burning for 18 minutes so jonathan snipes and william hudson totally killed it on the sonic end of things here as they usually do but let&amp;#39;s not also forget here david flexing his talents not just as a rapper but as a narrator on this one because he&amp;#39;s telling legitimately hair-raising stories track after track here so that brings us to visions of bodies which for all intents and purposes is pretty much another helping of all of that which i can&amp;#39;t stress enough is a good thing it&amp;#39;s actually really impressive the one two punch that clipping has assembled here staying true to their style and their sound while embarking on a new concept which they have kept fresh for two different records a year apart both of which explore said concept in different ways on different tracks while pushing sonic boundaries from end to end we have 16 cuts on this thing which include a handful of interludes to space things out and of course what&amp;#39;s a clipping album without an intro so loud and distorted that that sound hits your ears with the crackle of a wildfire the intro starts with these deep thunderous resonant thumps basically the sound of something frightening approaching the pounding and the pounding becomes louder and clearer eventually becoming the rhythmic backing for david&amp;#39;s rapping which sounds like it&amp;#39;s coming out of a very small phone speaker like he&amp;#39;s some kind of killer telling you the last thing you&amp;#39;re gonna hear before you die there are some really strange and interesting rhythmic switch-ups in davie&amp;#39;s rhymes and eventually as he starts to gain up a very fast amount of momentum he hits you with that it&amp;#39;s clipping following this is the infectious and groovy say the name that ghetto boy&amp;#39;s loop is absolutely an ear worm the baseline is sick too i also love how the instrumental generally is so dark it&amp;#39;s so heavy and yet it&amp;#39;s not super busy either it&amp;#39;s simple but effective david&amp;#39;s cold-blooded flows dance on top of these grooves as they develop into something that feels like i don&amp;#39;t know nine-inch nails closer but uh with a smooth clubby flare however the sound of the song in its beginning stages is a stark contrast from all of the grand twangy and metallic instrumentation building up in the final leg that sounds like an industrial take on persian music not entirely sure where that&amp;#39;s coming from but it is an amazing display of sound and quite a cool transition lyrically david borrows a lot of themes from classic slasher flicks portraying a bunch of young sexy protagonists getting ready to party but they&amp;#39;re actually just going to be butchered to death while also tying that into the horror folklore of the candy man you say his name five times which has parallels with bloody mary pretty classic trope at this point that is incorporated very creatively we also have 96 nev campbell who is obviously known for playing a major role in the scream movie franchise and the song ends up being another groovy murderous banger that goes into somewhat familiar territory for them it&amp;#39;s not a conceptual take on a slasher flick per se though i do think that sound effect of the bang bang bang worked into the beat is pretty genius rather you can add this song to the steady stream of clipping tracks that feature strong deadly female characters the most obvious of which is body and blood in the first leg of the song david builds up this story of a mean merciless queen pretty much setting up guest rappers cam in china for success as they go to town on the beat with one slick and threatening bar after another they also sound completely unfazed by the potential of a deadly killer who would most likely just become their prey anyway then with the following something underneath things become a lot more narrative and a lot less accessible bustling stuttering disorienting noise becomes the soundtrack to some pretty unnerving bars about a flood of i think possessed cannibals rising up very violently out of the earth and consuming basically anything that moves make them dead seize the trio pushing things into even more abrasive territory as david spits screeds over a wall of harsh distortion ear piercing tones if you&amp;#39;re not into noise and power electronics um you might be kind of departing here but if you are it&amp;#39;s some legitimately decimating sound design regardless though i do love the track&amp;#39;s cultish vocal harmonies and the way the compression on those kick drums really shake the distortion in the drones and the instrumental lyrically david seems to be going into the details of a ritualistic murder i&amp;#39;m sure the narrative&amp;#39;s open to interpretation to some degree but it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that an obsession with tradition and faith leads a group of people to forming a death cult based on religious rule then there&amp;#39;s also the very funny and freaky she bad which when i think of that phrase what comes to mind is usually someone sexy with unshakable confidence style and attitude but against hair-raising sound effects deep bass and twittering electronics the she that is so bad that david is describing is a murderous ghost that lives in the woods with dust skin and snake eyes and a forked tongue i&amp;#39;m not even going to tell you what happens to the unassuming group of partiers that saunter into the forest she haunts then pain every day is an absolutely mind-blowing spot on the record for the way it seamlessly brings together intricate idm rhythms horrifying sound effects grand string sections and a totally unique flow in 7 8 time and all of it progresses so naturally it works so well check the lock is another smooth operator with a killer baseline about a protagonist who is incredibly paranoid he&amp;#39;s checking his locks he&amp;#39;s checking under the hood of his car he&amp;#39;s checking his rear view mirror he&amp;#39;s driving through yellow lights he&amp;#39;s suspicious there&amp;#39;s something different now about the room that he&amp;#39;s in clearly a guy who&amp;#39;s afraid of being offed by a rival or an enemy and the way david lyrically dives into that paranoia it&amp;#39;s pretty potent the following looking like meat though in my opinion is one of the weaker moments here not for nothing but i think the beat on this one is a little overbearing yeah i know it&amp;#39;s not the only loud production on this record but between the massively distorted bass the massively distorted beats and david&amp;#39;s massively distorted vocals there&amp;#39;s not a lot of dynamics to it not a lot of sonic diversity in a way it feels almost like a throwback to a lot of the very abrasive material from their first mixtape but nowhere near as catchy then the atmospheric eerie and horror-inspired choruses that glide in very smoothly feel almost tacked on because they don&amp;#39;t complement the distortion all that well bringing punk wrap duo horror on for a feature definitely adds to the edgy and aggressive tone of the track but not its dynamics in terms of ideas it just feels like one of the thinner songs here but there&amp;#39;s not really a sticky beat or hook to make up for that visions of bodies does have a pretty strong ending though eaton alive features some uniquely layered wrapping that is super simple but still spine tingling the instrumental mainly consists of these scattered percussive sounds and loud metallic tones lyrically david is bringing together hip hop and horror swamp aesthetics for bar after bar big rims tall grass missing teeth but the molars are gold a wish a would step up in this swamp cause i guess after that point these scary swamp people are are gonna kill you the noisy instrumental freakout at the end is a really cool and unexpected change of pace certainly plays into the trio&amp;#39;s tradition of celebrating different forms of avant-garde and noise-based music too then we have the very morbid body for the pile which a lot of you who are clipping fans may be familiar with at this point the release of the song goes back to 2016 so nothing entirely new here but still it&amp;#39;s awesome just how much the instrumental and themes of the song play into the already established sounds and ideas of this record it&amp;#39;s just pretty much slipping on like a glove plus given all the anti-police brutality protests as of late the ideas of this track are more relevant now than ever then to top things off with in lacing we have another smooth head nodding banger with massive bass love the haunting and hypnotic pitched vocal samples in the instrumental on this one also david sung hook too some of the best and most surrealist bars on this and there existed turn up here while the way the blinds can play that tattoo stripes across the face that wait how are you looking at your face when your face is on your face this is something you should face you should the song slap though the whole thing is like having an acid trip during an apocalyptic trap song and as far as the horror element of this track goes it&amp;#39;s certainly moving into more psychological territory then to finish things off like they usually do clipping offers their own take on a piece of process music or a performance art piece this time it&amp;#39;s yoko ono&amp;#39;s secret piece which is a pretty interesting and perfect way to end this project because not only does it allow them to bring their collaborators back in a really subtle way to just add to the record one more time but the sounds of birds chirping and dawn as it were rising allows these two horror themed albums to finish off i guess on a somewhat positive note things are brighter next day is here the creepy things have gone away and overall wow just wow one amazing track after another i think uh catchier and harder hitting a little bit more than there existed though both records are fantastic and i think add to each other in a myriad of different ways as an overall experience and art piece clipping just continues to prove themselves as one of the most groundbreaking boundary-pushing and creative acts out there in hip-hop in modern music in general and just can&amp;#39;t wait to hear what they do next they absolutely killed it on this one feeling a decent two strong nine here tran position have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what

from australian rappers singer and songwriter tk miza who for years has been making a massive amount of sound down under becoming one of the most versatile and creative voices to rise up out of strya&amp;#39;s robust music scene her talents have been recognized internationally to a slight degree thus far i mean how many australian artists can boast a killer mic feature on their dblp but her 2016 self-titled record does feel like a lifetime ago in terms of evolution overall it is a very fun pop rap record with an experimental edge a lot of dance beats and huge m.i.a vibes she has since expanded into trap neo-soul and a larger variety of dance grooves with this last year was weird series that began in 2018 and now we are getting the second installment of that and it is easily one of the best collections of songs i have heard in 2020. this ep is so consistently good and stylistically diverse that it&amp;#39;s hard to believe the songs here are all attributed to one artist we have the opening track my flowers which is a delicate funky and enveloping piece of neo soul with an immaculate hook attached to it these are my flowers these are my flowers i just need to be cradled in this quest love type beat the warm keys and tk&amp;#39;s super cute melodic silky flows it&amp;#39;s enchanting then we have a total mood switch on the equally good 24k where tk suddenly breaks into a quality piece of hip house feels kind of like something kaytranada or goldlink would do but tk is kind of killing them on on their sound kind of killing them a little bit with love the vocals in comparison with the opener are a lot bolder the flows are fun and she drops some cheeky bars about money fashion and of course tetris which believe it or not is not the only tetris bar on the ep then we get shook which is a blaring and funky piece of pop wrap that feels like a combination of missy elliot and pharrell we have this booming lunch table beat on the song some bold synth hits some interesting transitions along the way too then beyond that it&amp;#39;s all about tk with these super carefree infectious bars that remind me of stuff the cool kids used to do back in the day great hook too next the song awake shouldn&amp;#39;t be too new to anyone in my audience not only because there is a jpeg mafia feature on it but i also named this track as one of my favorite tracks of 2019. this thing is a dark grimy trap banger with a slightly industrial beat i also love the thematic bars about staying awake at all hours of the night being an insomniac essentially feeling wired in the information age then tk keeps things kind of moody and aggressive on the following grasshopper which in my opinion between the grooves and the flows does have a very subtle a very slight grime edge to it i love that she has dipped into that sound even if just a little bit on this one plus i think the track list being as short as it is could have used another banger so good thing this song got worked into the mix i love the way tk&amp;#39;s flow in the second verse gets super melodic really switching it up to the point where it&amp;#39;s like she plays her own feature on the song which is a funny sensation she creates also on the track pb jam another neo soul cut with lots of bass punchy drums some light subtle touches of psychedelic effects here and there on a few elements there&amp;#39;s also kind of a breathy chill kaliyuchi&amp;#39;s vibe to the song as well but it&amp;#39;s more of a similarity than a rip-off then again just before the midpoint of the song tk comes through with this super bold sassy verse that&amp;#39;s like wow you&amp;#39;re doing everything it&amp;#39;s like you sound so radically different in this rap verse than you do with all the vocals everywhere else you&amp;#39;re just you&amp;#39;re just being your own feature you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re three different voices you&amp;#39;re five different styles you&amp;#39;re everywhere it&amp;#39;s fantastic of course i have to give a nod to these songs which is a bubbly pop cut with a huge bossa nova flavor coming through on the guitars funny ad-libs playful lead vocals and a gorgeous pre-chorus overall just a great tune with lots of personality and lyrics about pettiness and cutting people out of your life who i guess are just toxic then laughing at the way their toxicity makes them miserable and unhappy then with the closing track don&amp;#39;t call me again with kari foe this one is a pretty grand closer in terms of emotional potency there is a lot of heartache here stylistically the track sounds like a seamless throwback of 90s pop and more neo-soul but with a crisp contemporary delivery that keeps it from feeling like an exercise in nostalgia tk&amp;#39;s vocal harmonies on the track are fantastic and foe&amp;#39;s rap verse on the song has this deep vocal tone to it so confident so commanding it&amp;#39;s just the thing the song needed yeah there is not a single dud on this ep there really is not i do think tk does still have little ways to go in terms of redefining her influences flipping them in a way that is a bit more distinct and also refining things down until she hits upon a sound that is truly uniquely her but still that does not take away from the fact that we have nothing but good songs good production good performances sticky lyrics and interesting variety of styles as well and finally from front to back hit after hit after hit after hit feeling a light too decent nine on this ep tran position have you given this ep a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don&amp;#39;t cry hit

    "transcript": "uh hi everyone big thingy burp tano here the internet&amp;#39;s busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new blue and exile album miles this is the latest collection of songs from two west coast underground legends rapper blue producer exile about 13 years ago these two offered one of the best hip-hop albums to come out of california in the 2000s below the heavens a witty thoughtful and uplifting set of tracks that put these two on the map sadly though the music industry utterly failed to elevate their respective talents in the coming years especially blue whose big major label debut new york was completely botched in terms of roll out but as soon as he was released from his obligations to warner brothers records his creativity began to flow again as did exiles they eventually linked up once more with blue writing to a ton of beats that exile had passed him which would eventually become their 2011 record give me my flowers while i can still smell them which was a good release but not nearly as focused or as high impact as below the heavens was more of a surreal vibey and abstract experience so that was it 2011 that was the last time these two dropped a record together now of course blue and exile have respectively been involved in respectable projects since then blue&amp;#39;s record with oh no a long red hot los angeles summer night i think is one of his best in general but for many fans of blue and exiles music nothing has hit quite like their stuff together which leads us to miles where these two are really making up for lost time with 20 tracks and 95 minutes of material there are actually multiple tracks on this thing that reach 5 minutes 6 minutes the song roots of blue breezes past 9 minutes without an issue and it&amp;#39;s just blue wrapping there are quite a few tracks here where blue is bringing back that fabled third verse and sometimes even the fourth verse so blue and exile aren&amp;#39;t just giving a lot on this record they&amp;#39;re asking a lot too because this is a lot of material but miraculously the songs on miles aren&amp;#39;t really all that hard to appreciate somehow this album has managed the laser-focused conceptuality of below the heavens but reaching a few layers deeper while also pulling off the pillowy textured jazz laced ecstasy of give me my flowers but again like a bit elevated in terms of quality and detail so yes the sound of this record for blue and exile it is familiar this is familiar territory but simultaneously the both of them sound wise beyond their years at this point blue seems to have so much more personal experience to pull from in his bars as he dives into fatherhood spirituality america hip-hop jazz you could make a whole ep of the songs on this album where he&amp;#39;s just going at the blue angle on this record blue as i can be all the blues you ain&amp;#39;t never blue just to name a couple and it&amp;#39;s interesting that blue can approach a topic on a song and then return to it later on the album with a different reference point or a different angle and still have it sound refreshing whether it be the song miles davis where blue is going on about mastering his artistic craft or retelling the personal story and history of miles davis on the song all the blues and then with spread sunshine with the constant mentioning of traveling miles and miles to this place and that place in this place it&amp;#39;s a really cool characteristic to the album that makes the entire hour and a half of it feel really cohesive since most of the tracks seem to be narratively linked together like a labyrinth of secret caves now before i get into the specifics of some of the tracks here keep in mind the vast majority of the large amount of material on this record is impeccable i didn&amp;#39;t really get the sense that any of what i heard here was throw away or filler just to kill time and the magic behind these songs is pretty simple beats and rhymes good beats and rhymes some of the best beats and rhymes blue and exile have been responsible for the production highlights on this thing are many really too many to name but i do love the dramatic and unlikely groove and surreal vocal samples and angelic strings on the opener blue red yellow green then we get the booming kicks and what sounds like barbershop style vocal harmonies on when the gods meet i&amp;#39;m very unsure about the origin of this vocal sample or really the style that it&amp;#39;s supposed to be embodying but i do love what it&amp;#39;s doing for the track aesthetically and i think exile chops it up beautifully the thick rush of keys that hit the high contrast chorus on the song are absolutely perfect too there&amp;#39;s also some rich pianos a gently funky beat warm bass on the song the feeling the whole thing sounds like a deep orangey sunrise hitting some city streets in the early am the whole vibe of the instrumental is cinematic it&amp;#39;s gorgeous it&amp;#39;s moving i get a similar vibe from the beat on the american dream but a bit peppier troubled water the way the tragic vocal harmonies hit against the very heavy classic boombap groove on this track it sounds like a kanye throwback the production on roots of blue takes an oddly primal turn with what sounds like some hand percussion with a wooden timbre a dark bluesy acoustic guitar lick hefty hip-hop drums some indigenous vocal samples it is such a fantastically hypnotic loop and vibe that again goes for nine minutes this is the longest track on the entire lp and yet over the course of this song it never really gets stale with dear lord the vintage and anthemic horns along with the gospel style vocal harmonies with the gemetta rose hook is enough to bring tears to my eyes this track instrumentally and lyrically too is like a flawless beam of hope and aspiration and positivity that is just so desperately lacking in everything right now beyond that there are the many many and i mean many songs that function off of really colorful beautiful and fantastic jazz samples which would add five or ten more minutes onto the review to go over every single one but there is a lot of high quality production on this record and blue does some great things with it whether it be the color based wordplay on the intro to the record which i think is really smart thoughtful and inspiring or the song the feeling where blue goes over essentially how the music industry kind of chewed him up and spit him out but for him of course to live to see another day tell the tale and creatively come out ahead music is my everything sees blue rapping about his earliest introductions to popular music and the way his life intersected with it beyond that including his mom marrying a preacher who said that secular music was off limits essentially these are just a few of many tales of personal progression on this album including brightest stars which not only has a great guest feature from freestyle fellowships ac alone but if you listen close here you&amp;#39;ll also hear blue rapping about starting out rapping and wanting to essentially hit listeners with really materialistic and conceited bars but then growing beyond that because he felt like he wasn&amp;#39;t being true to himself blue as i can be then stands out for its relentless flows and super intricate rhyme patterns blue&amp;#39;s performance here is just incredible troubled water as well scratches a similarly flashy itch then with miles away we see blue getting nostalgic sentimental rapping about being away traveling others being away talking about people he knows caught up in the prison system or his cousins being drafted but then simultaneously the song is also about traveling miles moving forward progressing changing just one more super thoughtful moment on the record essentially then to go back to the track roots of blue i am consistently blown away at just how all encompassing this song is with blue rapping about the early civilizations african tribes abrahamic religions american slavery the roots of various american music genres for verse after verse after verse blue is just on another level of conceptuality when it comes to hip-hop right now you could say a lot of these themes get extended into the song african dream but with more of an afrocentric angle then blue showcases more entrepreneurial aspirations on the song the american dream which is not just a series of bars about his own personal hopes and dreams but it&amp;#39;s simultaneously a commentary on the almighty dollar being america&amp;#39;s religion essentially lyrically dear lord is such a powerful message of unity and peace and empathy and caring just really destroying and breaking down everything that separates mankind from this possibility be it borders or war violence bigotry hatred organized religion we then get hit with one of the weirder tracks in the tracklist in my opinion to the fall but not forgotten there are some cultural figures that he name drops that you know might not be the best i mean like fidel castro or dr sebby whose scientific methods weren&amp;#39;t exactly like you know proven so truth be told there are some questionable bars on this record here and there but the lowest points on the album i found to be just underwhelming whether that be on the kind of bland true and livin whose verses i found to be kind of feel good but somewhat vague in their intentions then the song you ain&amp;#39;t never blue features some rapping from exile who yes also does rap although he&amp;#39;s not known to do it particularly well and that is very much apparent in this track here where he is lyrically going up against blue the color the sky water in my eyes line is kind of strange that other flubbed bar where he says put the sorrows in the verse and then it&amp;#39;s like like there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s something that feels lost in translation at this point and then the the get dap part of the line if you listen to it you&amp;#39;ll know what i&amp;#39;m saying there&amp;#39;s definitely something like missing from this part or there was a stumble or whatever big blue soul you ain&amp;#39;t even have a little put your hand out i&amp;#39;ll give you my favorite color of skittle why why outside of those moments though this record is great i love this record i think it&amp;#39;s a fantastic record one of the best hip-hop projects in either artist&amp;#39;s discography potentially the best hip-hop project of this year and i think it&amp;#39;s going to be a while before we hear a jazz rap album that steps to this one in terms of just how massive creative and well-crafted it is feeling a light nine on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you&amp;#39;re the best you&amp;#39;re the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please
